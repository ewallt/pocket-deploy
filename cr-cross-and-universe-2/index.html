<header class="h"><h1>The Silence of God</h1><p class="intro">*When heaven’s restraint reveals love’s patience, not absence.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>In the story of suffering, the hardest mystery is divine silence. When Christ cried, “Why have You forsaken Me?” no voice answered. Yet this silence was not neglect; it was participation. God entered the experience of absence so that none need face it alone.</p>
<p>Silence is the cost of allowing freedom to play out honestly. To intervene too soon would have vindicated power, not love. By waiting, God allowed evil to reveal its nature, and righteousness to show its endurance. The universe learned through what was not said as much as through what was done.</p>
<p>In history, too, God’s delays serve mercy. The unrepentant interpret patience as indifference, but those who know His heart recognize the self-restraint of love. Wrath postponed is grace extended.</p>
<p>The silence of God is not the stillness of neglect but of wisdom. The Judge waits until all evidence is in. The Father listens longer than justice requires, because relationship, not retribution, is His aim.</p>
<p>When heaven seems quiet, the cross reminds us what that quiet means: not abandonment, but the refusal to coerce. Love is still ruling, still reasoning, still redeeming—in silence that speaks louder than words.</p>
