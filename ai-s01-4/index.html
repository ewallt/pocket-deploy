<header class="h"><h1>Representation & Alignment Seeds — Part 4</h1><p class="intro">The quest to make models not only fluent but faithful began earlier than the transformer era—through vector semantics, structured attention, and nascent alignment ideas.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Representation learning reframed the problem: instead of engineering features, train networks to discover them. Word2vec and GloVe mapped words into continuous spaces where analogies emerged as geometric relations. This revealed meaning as direction rather than discrete identity. Yet embeddings were context-free; “bank” meant finance or river depending on neighbors. Solutions like ELMo introduced context-dependent embeddings through bidirectional RNNs, hinting that language meaning lives in sequences, not tokens alone.</p>
<p>Attention mechanisms evolved as targeted memory systems. Additive and dot-product attention let decoders weight encoder states by relevance, approximating human selective focus. These modules inspired variants—self-attention within sentences, hierarchical attention over documents. Researchers noted that attention weights offered interpretability, showing which inputs mattered most, though later work questioned how faithfully they reflected reasoning. Still, attention democratized representation learning by exposing interaction patterns explicitly.</p>
<p>Early alignment efforts paralleled these architectural moves. In reinforcement learning, reward shaping adjusted agent objectives to match human intent. In dialogue systems, imitation and inverse reinforcement learning tried to infer preferences from behavior. These initiatives shared one ambition: tether machine objectives to human values rather than narrow metrics. Even before “alignment” became a buzzword, the tension between optimizing loss functions and capturing meaning was recognized.</p>
<p>Transfer and multitask learning expanded generality. Sharing parameters across tasks exposed networks to diverse supervision signals, enabling cross-domain benefits. Fine-tuning, still manual, presaged the pretrain–adapt pattern that would dominate later. Researchers observed diminishing returns from single-task overfitting and sought representations that encoded transferable abstractions—an implicit alignment to the structure of reality rather than dataset quirks.</p>
<p>Visualization and probing tools attempted to make sense of internal states. Saliency maps, activation clustering, and layer-wise relevance analysis revealed partial organization—syntax here, semantics there—but no consistent interpretive map. Still, these diagnostics fueled the expectation that networks could be made more transparent if their attention or embedding spaces were structured properly. That hope became the philosophical seed for explainability research.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the field was converging on the principles transformers would unify: context-dependent representation via self-attention, scalable transfer through shared pretraining, and incipient alignment by design rather than patch. What lacked was the simple blueprint to integrate these threads at scale—a model architecture both elegant and parallel enough to make the dream operational.</p>
