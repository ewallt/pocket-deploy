<header class="h"><h1>Bounded Sequences</h1><p class="intro">What boundedness means, examples that converge vs oscillate, and what BWT promises.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>A sequence (aₙ) is bounded if there exists a real number M such that |aₙ| ≤ M for all n. Equivalently, all terms lie in the interval [−M, M]. Boundedness is a simple constraint—it says the sequence doesn't run off to infinity or negative infinity—but it permits considerable variety in behavior. A bounded sequence can converge smoothly, oscillate periodically, or wander chaotically within its confines. Boundedness alone doesn't guarantee convergence, yet it sets the stage for BWT's surprising conclusion: within any bounded sequence, some subsequence converges.</p>
<p>Convergent sequences are always bounded. If aₙ → L, then for ε = 1, all but finitely many terms lie in (L − 1, L + 1), and the finitely many outliers are bounded by the maximum absolute value among them. Thus convergence implies boundedness. The converse fails: the sequence (−1)ⁿ is bounded but doesn't converge, oscillating forever between −1 and +1. Similarly, the sequence sin(n) is bounded in [−1, 1] but has no limit—it behaves pseudo-randomly, visiting neighborhoods of many points infinitely often. Boundedness is necessary for convergence in ℝ but far from sufficient.</p>
<p>Examples illuminate the gap between bounded and convergent. The constant sequence aₙ = 5 is bounded and converges to 5 trivially. The sequence aₙ = 1/n is bounded and converges to 0, monotonically decreasing. In contrast, the alternating sequence aₙ = (−1)ⁿ is bounded but diverges; yet BWT guarantees convergent subsequences: the even-indexed subsequence converges to 1, the odd-indexed to −1. The sequence aₙ = sin(n) is trickier—bounded but seemingly without pattern—yet BWT still insists some subsequence converges. This is non-constructive: we can't easily name the subsequence, but existence is assured by the theorem.</p>
<p>Monotone sequences paired with boundedness do converge—the Monotone Convergence Theorem states that a monotone bounded sequence converges. If (aₙ) is increasing and bounded above, it converges to its supremum. This is a consequence of completeness: the bounded set {aₙ} has a least upper bound L, and the sequence, forced upward but capped, must approach L. BWT generalizes beyond monotonicity: even without order structure, boundedness guarantees convergent subsequences. Monotone convergence is a special case where the entire sequence cooperates; BWT handles the chaotic case by extracting a well-behaved subsequence.</p>
<p>Cauchy sequences provide another lens. A sequence is Cauchy if terms get arbitrarily close to each other: for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all m, n > N, |aₘ − aₙ| < ε. In ℝ, Cauchy sequences converge (completeness again). Every Cauchy sequence is bounded—once terms cluster, they can't spread far. BWT ensures that bounded sequences have convergent subsequences, which in turn helps prove that Cauchy sequences converge: if a Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence, the whole sequence converges to the same limit. Boundedness, Cauchy conditions, and convergent subsequences interlock tightly in ℝ.</p>
<p>BWT's promise to bounded sequences is this: no matter how wild your bounded sequence, you can find indices n₁ < n₂ < n₃ < … such that a_{n_k} converges. This subsequence focuses on an infinitesimal sliver of the sequence's behavior where order emerges. It might not be the whole story—other subsequences might converge to different limits, or diverge—but at least one convergent thread exists. Boundedness is the minimal entry ticket; BWT honors it with guaranteed accumulation. This transforms bounded sequences from potentially chaotic to analytically tractable, enabling proofs that rely on extracting limits from boundedness alone.</p>
