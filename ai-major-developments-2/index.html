<header class="h"><h1>Symbolic AI and the Logic Era — Part 2</h1><p class="intro">No, the first AI systems did not learn from experience; they reasoned through symbols, rules, and formal structures borrowed from logic itself.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Symbolic AI emerged from the conviction that intelligence could be described as a set of explicit rules. Early systems such as the Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver modeled reasoning as search through a space of symbols. This was a translation of mathematical logic into program form: statements, operators, and heuristics replaced neurons and flesh.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, the approach flourished in expert systems. Knowledge was stored as if-then rules, and reasoning was inference over them. In domains such as medicine and chemistry, symbolic AI performed astonishingly well—so long as its world remained small, consistent, and well-defined. Reality, however, was messier than its ontologies.</p>
<p>The philosophical confidence behind symbolic AI was logical positivism: that truth could be fully captured in language and syntax. Its architects believed that if knowledge could be encoded, reason could be automated. This yielded a generation of knowledge engineers who translated expertise into rules and revised them as exceptions multiplied.</p>
<p>Critics such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle attacked the enterprise as misconceived. They argued that human intelligence depends on context, embodiment, and intuition—dimensions no syntax could capture. The Chinese Room thought experiment posed the challenge succinctly: following rules for symbols is not the same as understanding them.</p>
<p>Yet symbolic AI left an enduring legacy. It taught computers to reason about meaning and structure, pioneered knowledge representation, and shaped fields like semantic web and automated planning. Its tools still underpin modern AI pipelines that combine logical reasoning with neural intuition.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the logic era was a necessary experiment. It mapped the limits of explicit reasoning and prepared the ground for learning-based systems to fill the gaps. What began as an attempt to replace intuition with rules ended by showing why rules alone are never enough.</p>
