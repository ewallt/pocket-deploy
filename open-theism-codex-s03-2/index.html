<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · Alternative Models: Arminianism, Molinism, and Calvinism.</p>
<article>
<p>Evaluating open theism requires comparing it with other models of divine providence. Classical Arminianism affirms libertarian freedom and prevenient grace while maintaining that God exhaustively foreknows future free choices. Arminians explain this by appealing to God’s timeless perspective and insist that foreknowledge does not cause events. Molinism, rooted in Luis de Molina’s sixteenth-century work, posits middle knowledge: God knows what every creature would freely do in any circumstance, enabling God to actualize a world aligning with divine purposes. Calvinism emphasizes meticulous sovereignty, asserting that God ordains whatsoever comes to pass while holding humans responsible.</p>
<p>Arminianism and open theism share commitments to God’s universal love and desire for relationship. Both reject unconditional election and insist that grace can be resisted. The key difference lies in foreknowledge. Arminians maintain that God eternally knows each free decision, whereas open theists claim that future contingents are not yet knowable. Critics argue that open theism lacks the assurance provided by Arminian foreknowledge, while proponents counter that their model better preserves freedom and makes sense of biblical depictions of divine repentance.</p>
<p>Molinism offers a sophisticated alternative. By positing middle knowledge, Molinists assert that God can choose to create the world in which creatures freely make the decisions that fulfill divine plans. This retains exhaustive foreknowledge and libertarian freedom simultaneously. Open theists challenge the coherence of middle knowledge, questioning how counterfactuals of freedom can possess truth value prior to God’s creative decree. They also argue that Molinism effectively renders the future as fixed as Calvinism, because God selects a specific feasible world whose outcomes are certain once actualized.</p>
<p>Calvinism presents the sharpest contrast. It affirms compatibilist freedom, meaning that human choices are free when arising from their desires, even if those desires are determined by God’s decree. Calvinists emphasize God’s glory in orchestrating all events, including salvation and reprobation. Open theists critique this view for implicating God in evil and undermining genuine love. Calvinists respond that God’s sovereignty and goodness are fully compatible, citing scriptural passages about predestination and divine control. The debate often turns on differing intuitions about justice, freedom, and the nature of divine glory.</p>
<p>These models also shape pastoral practice. Arminianism encourages cooperation with prevenient grace through evangelism and discipleship, trusting God’s foreknowledge to guide mission. Molinism reassures believers that God has wisely chosen the best feasible world where free choices accomplish divine goals. Calvinism fosters confidence in God’s meticulous plan, inspiring trust amid suffering. Open theism emphasizes relational participation, urging believers to partner with God in shaping an open future through prayer and faithful action. Each framework offers distinct motivations and challenges for Christian spirituality.</p>
<p>Ecumenical dialogue reveals that no single model resolves every tension. Arminians question whether open theism adequately safeguards prophecy; Molinists scrutinize its logic; Calvinists challenge its portrayal of sovereignty. Open theists critique the other systems for minimizing relational dynamics or implicating God in determinism. The diversity of perspectives underscores the complexity of reconciling divine attributes with human freedom. Engaging these alternatives helps clarify what is at stake in adopting the open view.</p>
<p>Ultimately, open theism positions itself as a reform movement emphasizing love, freedom, and relational risk. By contrasting it with Arminianism, Molinism, and Calvinism, readers can discern how each tradition balances sovereignty and responsibility. The comparison invites ongoing theological reflection on how best to articulate God’s partnership with creation.</p>
