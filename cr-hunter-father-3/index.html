<header class="h"><h1>Love That Stays Involved</h1><p class="intro">*Accommodation is saving presence at work within our self-chosen limits.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>When the father stays, he steps into a careful choreography: instruction that restrains, presence that protects, patience that absorbs misunderstanding. His goal is not to make hunting admirable, but survivable. He keeps his son within earshot of wisdom so that recklessness has less room to grow.</p>
<p>This is what divine accommodation looks like in history. God remains with people who will not yet abandon the ways they insist upon. He shapes what He can—timing, boundaries, tone—so that the worst impulses are curbed and the best possibilities stay alive.</p>
<p>Such involvement is costly. The father’s reputation suffers; observers call him inconsistent. Likewise, God bears the slander of appearing to approve what He merely permits. The charge is inevitable wherever love chooses proximity over purity of appearance.</p>
<p>But love is stubborn. It refuses the neatness of withdrawal because withdrawal surrenders the beloved to ignorance. Presence keeps a path open for future repentance, and in the meantime mitigates harm that would otherwise escalate unchecked.</p>
<p>Accommodation is not plan B; it is how saving love behaves in a world of genuine freedom. If God coerced, He would cancel the person He seeks to heal. By staying, He honors the will while pleading with it, shaping it, and waiting for consent to deeper change.</p>
<p>In this light, the father’s decision is not moral compromise but moral courage. He risks being misread to keep the child alive long enough to learn why the father never hunted in the first place.</p>
