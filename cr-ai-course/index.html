        "categories": {
          "unit-1-key-concepts": { "display_order": 10, "name": "Unit 1: What Is AI? Key Concepts and Terminology", "display_name": "Unit 1", "introduction": "This unit provides a comprehensive foundation in Artificial Intelligence. It defines what AI is, distinguishes between its major forms, and introduces the key concepts and terminology that will be used throughout the course. Each section is written as a full mini-lesson, giving you the context and clarity needed before diving into more advanced modules.", "paragraphs": [ { "heading": "Defining Artificial Intelligence", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the design of computer systems that can perform tasks which, if a human carried them out, would be considered intelligent. These tasks include recognizing patterns in data, making predictions, solving problems, and understanding natural language. Unlike traditional software that relies on explicit programming rules, AI systems often learn from examples and improve over time as they are exposed to more data. This distinction between static rules and adaptive systems is at the heart of AI’s transformative power. When we talk about AI today, we are usually referring to machine learning systems—algorithms that adjust their internal parameters to better map inputs to outputs. For example, rather than programming every detail of how to recognize a cat in an image, engineers provide thousands of labeled cat photos, and the system learns the common features on its own. This approach has led to breakthroughs in language translation, medical diagnostics, and recommendation systems, reshaping entire industries. Understanding this definition provides a grounding for everything that follows in this course." }, { "heading": "Narrow vs. General Intelligence", "content": "One of the most important distinctions in AI is between narrow intelligence and general intelligence. Narrow AI, sometimes called weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task or a small range of tasks. Examples include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, spam filters for email, and facial recognition in photo libraries. These systems can perform their narrow tasks extremely well but lack flexibility—your spam filter cannot drive a car, and your voice assistant cannot diagnose diseases. General AI, on the other hand, would have the ability to learn and adapt across many domains, much like a human being can. It would reason, plan, and transfer knowledge from one area to another. Despite its portrayal in movies and speculative fiction, general AI does not yet exist and remains a long-term research goal. Most of the progress and applications we see today belong firmly to the realm of narrow AI. Recognizing this difference is crucial: narrow AI has already changed the world, while general AI is still hypothetical." }, { "heading": "Rules, Machine Learning, and Heuristics", "content": "Before the dominance of machine learning, early AI research focused on rule-based systems. In such systems, experts hand-crafted rules that computers would follow. For example, a medical diagnostic system might ask a series of yes/no questions and then apply rules to suggest possible illnesses. These systems worked well in highly structured domains but often failed in messy, real-world scenarios because it was impossible to encode every exception. Machine learning took a different approach, allowing the system to discover patterns in data rather than relying entirely on pre-written rules. Heuristics, or practical shortcuts, still play a role in AI—sometimes a well-chosen heuristic can reduce computation time or guide a model’s search for solutions. In practice, many modern AI systems combine all three approaches: they use machine learning to recognize patterns, heuristics to make quick decisions, and rules to enforce boundaries or comply with regulations. This hybrid design makes them both flexible and controllable." }, { "heading": "Data, Features, and Labels", "content": "At the heart of every AI system is data. Data can take many forms: numbers in a spreadsheet, images, video, or snippets of text. Features are the aspects of that data that are used by the model to make predictions. In image recognition, features might be edges, textures, or color distributions; in natural language processing, they might be word tokens or embeddings. Labels are the ground truth values used in supervised learning—what the system is supposed to predict. For instance, in an email spam filter, the features are derived from the text of the email, and the labels are 'spam' or 'not spam.' The quality of the features and labels directly influences model performance. Poorly labeled data leads to confusion and inaccurate predictions, while well-structured data allows the system to generalize effectively. Understanding how data, features, and labels interact is essential because these choices determine whether an AI project succeeds or fails." }, { "heading": "Training vs. Inference", "content": "The life cycle of an AI model can be divided into two phases: training and inference. Training is the process by which the model learns from data. During training, algorithms adjust millions or even billions of parameters to minimize errors on the provided examples. This process is computationally intensive, often requiring specialized hardware like GPUs. Once training is complete, the model moves to inference: applying what it has learned to new, unseen data. For example, a trained image classifier may have been taught with millions of photos, but inference is when it correctly identifies a new photo uploaded by a user. Training may occur only occasionally, but inference must happen quickly and efficiently whenever the system is used. Understanding this distinction helps you grasp why companies often centralize training in data centers but deploy inference models on edge devices, phones, or browsers where speed and responsiveness matter most." }, { "heading": "Symbolic vs. Statistical Approaches", "content": "AI can be broadly divided into symbolic and statistical approaches. Symbolic AI, also called 'good old-fashioned AI,' relies on explicit representations of knowledge. It uses symbols, rules, and logic to reason about problems. Chess programs from the 1980s, for example, relied heavily on symbolic reasoning, encoding expert knowledge and searching through possibilities. Statistical AI, by contrast, focuses on learning patterns from large datasets. Machine learning and neural networks are examples of statistical approaches, relying less on explicit rules and more on probabilities. Today’s breakthroughs, from large language models to image recognition systems, come primarily from statistical AI. However, symbolic methods are still relevant. Some researchers believe hybrid systems—combining the structure of symbolic reasoning with the adaptability of statistical learning—will be necessary for building more trustworthy and interpretable AI. Knowing both traditions helps clarify the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches." }, { "heading": "Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning", "content": "Machine learning is not a single technique but a family of approaches. In supervised learning, models learn from labeled examples. Given thousands of emails marked 'spam' or 'not spam,' the system learns to classify new ones. In unsupervised learning, there are no labels—models look for structure in the data, such as grouping customers into segments based on purchasing habits. Reinforcement learning is different: the system learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. A reinforcement learner might play a video game, improving its strategy by maximizing its score. Each approach has strengths and limitations. Supervised learning requires costly labeled data but delivers accurate results. Unsupervised learning reveals hidden patterns but may lack clear validation. Reinforcement learning can achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in specific domains, but it is computationally expensive and data-hungry. These three paradigms form the core of most modern AI applications." }, { "heading": "Generative vs. Discriminative Models", "content": "Models can also be classified as generative or discriminative. Discriminative models focus on distinguishing between categories—they learn decision boundaries between classes. Logistic regression and support vector machines are classic discriminative models. Generative models, on the other hand, attempt to model the underlying distribution of the data itself. They can create new examples that resemble the training data. Language models that generate fluent text, or image generators like diffusion models, are generative. Both types of models have practical uses: discriminative models are often simpler and more efficient for classification tasks, while generative models power applications in creativity, simulation, and unsupervised learning. Importantly, generative and discriminative methods are not mutually exclusive. In some cases, combining them produces more robust systems, such as semi-supervised learning where generative models help compensate for limited labeled data." }, { "heading": "Bias, Fairness, and Accountability", "content": "AI systems reflect the data they are trained on and the decisions made by their designers. This can lead to bias—systematic errors that disadvantage particular groups. For instance, a facial recognition system trained mostly on lighter-skinned individuals may perform poorly on darker-skinned individuals. Fairness in AI is not just a technical challenge but a social one, requiring careful dataset design, algorithmic audits, and diverse perspectives in development. Accountability means ensuring that when systems fail or cause harm, there are mechanisms to trace why decisions were made and to assign responsibility. This might include maintaining model documentation, audit trails, or even regulatory oversight. Addressing bias, fairness, and accountability from the outset prevents real-world harm and builds trust in AI deployments. Ignoring these issues, on the other hand, risks amplifying social inequalities and undermining confidence in the technology." }, { "heading": "AI System Boundaries", "content": "It is easy to think of AI as just the model itself, but in practice an AI system encompasses much more. Inputs must be collected, cleaned, and validated. Models must be trained, evaluated, and deployed into environments with specific constraints. Post-processing often shapes model outputs to meet business or ethical goals, while monitoring systems track performance over time to detect drift or anomalies. Human oversight, too, is an essential component, ensuring that AI complements rather than replaces critical decision-making. For example, in a medical AI system, predictions must be checked by trained professionals, with clear channels for escalation if errors occur. Thinking of AI in terms of complete systems, rather than isolated algorithms, helps practitioners anticipate challenges and design more reliable solutions. This system-level perspective concludes our foundational overview and prepares you for deeper dives in the modules to come." } ] },
