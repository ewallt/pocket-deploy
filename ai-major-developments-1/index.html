<header class="h"><h1>The Idea of Thinking Machines — Part 1</h1><p class="intro">No, the concept of artificial intelligence did not begin with computers; it began with the question of whether thought itself could be mechanized.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Long before silicon, human imagination wondered if reason could be built. From the automata of ancient myth to Descartes’ mechanical body, the dream was that mind might have structure. This idea matured in the age of logic and mathematics, when symbols replaced gears as the parts of thought. Boole and Leibniz hinted that thinking might be a form of calculation, and logic the code that ran it.</p>
<p>By the mid-twentieth century, Alan Turing transformed this philosophical intuition into a technical proposal. If reasoning is rule-bound, a machine following rules might simulate it. His “universal machine” provided a mathematical template for any computation that could be precisely described. The famous Turing Test shifted the debate from metaphysics to behavior: could a machine’s answers be indistinguishable from a human’s?</p>
<p>The first AI conference at Dartmouth in 1956 gave the idea a name and a community. Researchers believed intelligence would yield to formal rules just as physics had to mathematics. Optimism was as boundless as computing power was scarce. Early projects solved toy problems and proved theorems, but they also revealed how hard common sense is to encode.</p>
<p>In parallel, the conceptual debate widened. Philosophers asked whether computation could capture understanding or merely mimic its outputs. Psychologists and linguists wondered if the mind was a symbol system or something more dynamic. AI was thus born as an interdisciplinary conversation about the nature of thought itself.</p>
<p>Across these decades, two currents developed: symbolic logic and adaptive learning. The former sought certainty through explicit rules; the latter through experience and feedback. This division would define the field for half a century, as each side tried to explain intelligence in its own image.</p>
<p>Looking back, the dream of thinking machines was never just technical. It was a mirror for human self-understanding—how we conceive reason, creativity, and the mechanisms of mind. Every new model of AI still inherits this ancient question: what is it to think?</p>
