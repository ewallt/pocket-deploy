<section class="p">
<p>To live with God forever is to inhabit fire without fear. The way there is not technique but trust—daily consent to Love’s searching light. Prayer becomes exposure, Scripture a mirror, community a kiln. Bit by bit, what cannot live with love is surrendered, and what can live with love is strengthened.</p>
<p>Practically, this means choosing candor over image, reconciliation over resentment, and service over leverage. These are not mere ethics; they are training for an environment where only self-giving survives. The disciplines are not hoops to impress God but habits that tune us to His atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mission takes on a different heat. We bear witness not only in words but in methods that match the message—patience, honesty, generosity, non-retaliation. The world reads our God in our ways; to mirror the Cross is to invite others into a safe fire.</p>
<p>Suffering, too, is reinterpreted. It is not a sign of abandonment but an occasion for refining. What burns off in trial is the dross we could not pry loose otherwise. What remains is a quieter courage, a cleaner joy, a love harder to scandalize.</p>
<p>Hope peaks at the promise of a city where night is no more because the Lamb is its light. The future is not an escape from flame, but its fullness—creation transparent to God. Life at last will be fire-proof not by insulation but by transformation.</p>
<p>Until then, we practice living in the flame by inviting it now. “Search me… and lead me.” The prayer is daring because the love is safe. The One who burns is the One who blesses.</p>
