    <h1>How the Cross Awakens Trust & Transforms Life</h1>
    <p class="sub">Part 2 — Seeing love, becoming loyal</p>

    <p>The cross is the clearest window into God’s heart. There, God in Christ bears our hostility without retaliation, absorbs our blame without accusation, and breaks the cycle of violence by forgiveness. Love steps into the worst we can do and does not become like us in doing it.</p>

    <p>In that light, slanders against God’s character lose their force. If God were fundamentally self-protective, the cross would make no sense; but if God is self-giving, the cross is exactly what love would do. The spectacle of Calvary unmasks the Accuser and restores God’s credibility.</p>

    <p>Trust awakens as we linger before this revelation. We do not coerce our hearts into faith; we let them be persuaded by beauty and truth. The Spirit turns a fact into an encounter: “This love is for you.”</p>

    <p>Repentance becomes more than remorse; it is a turning toward the One we have misjudged. Seeing that the wound we gave was received as mercy, we surrender suspicion. The will aligns with love, not by force, but by admiration.</p>

    <p>Forgiveness follows. The cross tells us our debts are not the last word; God’s purpose is restoration. Freed from the burden of proving ourselves, we are liberated to love others with the same patience that met us.</p>

    <p>Life begins to take the shape of the cross: strength expressed as service, truth spoken without contempt, courage that refuses to hate. Communities formed by this vision become outposts of a different government—one where power is measured by the good it gives.</p>

    <p>Thus the cross does not merely secure a verdict; it secures our trust and reshapes our lives. To keep faith alive is to keep returning to this center, allowing love revealed there to renew mind, will, and hope.</p>
