<h1>Galois Theory: Origins and Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · What is a Group? Symmetry as Structure</p>
<article>
<p>A group is a set G equipped with a binary operation (often written as multiplication or composition) satisfying four axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. Formally, for all g, h, k ∈ G, the product gh is in G (closure); (gh)k = g(hk) (associativity); there exists an identity element e such that ge = eg = g for all g; and for each g there exists an inverse g⁻¹ such that gg⁻¹ = g⁻¹g = e. These simple axioms capture the essence of symmetry and reversible transformations. Groups appear throughout mathematics and science: the integers under addition, nonzero rationals under multiplication, permutations of a set, rotations of a geometric object, and symmetries of physical laws all form groups. The abstraction strips away inessential details, revealing common structural patterns.</p>
<p>The integers ℤ under addition provide the simplest infinite group. The operation is +, the identity is 0, and the inverse of n is −n. This group is abelian (commutative): m + n = n + m for all integers. By contrast, the nonzero rationals ℚ* under multiplication form another abelian group, with identity 1 and inverse 1/q for each nonzero rational q. Finite groups offer more variety. The integers modulo n, denoted ℤₙ or ℤ/nℤ, form a group under addition modulo n. For example, ℤ₅ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} with addition modulo 5: 3 + 4 = 2, and every element has an additive inverse (4 + 1 = 0, so 4 is the inverse of 1). These cyclic groups are fundamental building blocks in group theory and number theory.</p>
<p>Permutation groups illustrate non-abelian structure and arise naturally in Galois theory. The symmetric group Sₙ consists of all bijections (permutations) from the set {1, 2, ..., n} to itself, with composition as the operation. For n ≥ 3, Sₙ is non-abelian: composing permutations in different orders yields different results. For instance, in S₃, let σ = (1 2) swap 1 and 2, and τ = (1 2 3) cycle 1→2→3→1. Then στ sends 1→1, 2→3, 3→2, while τσ sends 1→2, 2→1, 3→3, so στ ≠ τσ. The order of Sₙ (the number of elements) is n!, which grows rapidly: S₅ has 120 elements. Permutation groups encode the symmetries of polynomial roots and are central to Galois's criterion for solvability.</p>
<p>Subgroups are subsets of a group that form groups under the same operation. If H ⊆ G, then H is a subgroup if it contains the identity, is closed under the group operation, and contains inverses of its elements. For example, the even integers 2ℤ form a subgroup of ℤ under addition. In Sₙ, the alternating group Aₙ consists of even permutations (those expressible as a product of an even number of transpositions) and is a subgroup of order n!/2. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group, providing a powerful constraint on group structure. Subgroups capture subsymmetries; in Galois theory, the intermediate subgroups correspond to intermediate field extensions, a correspondence formalized in the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.</p>
<p>Normal subgroups and quotient groups extend the structural hierarchy. A subgroup N of G is normal if gNg⁻¹ = N for all g ∈ G, meaning conjugation by any group element maps N to itself. Normal subgroups allow the construction of quotient groups G/N, whose elements are cosets of N. The quotient inherits a group structure from G, and there is a natural homomorphism G → G/N. For example, 2ℤ is a normal subgroup of ℤ, and the quotient ℤ/2ℤ is the two-element group {0, 1} representing even and odd integers. In Galois theory, normal subgroups correspond to normal (Galois) extensions, and the quotient describes the symmetries of the extension relative to a subfield. Solvable groups are those that can be built via a tower of normal subgroups with abelian quotients, directly connecting to solvability by radicals.</p>
<p>Homomorphisms are structure-preserving maps between groups. A function φ: G → H is a homomorphism if φ(gh) = φ(g)φ(h) for all g, h ∈ G. Homomorphisms relate different groups, revealing when two groups share structural features. The kernel ker(φ) = {g ∈ G : φ(g) = e_H} is always a normal subgroup of G, and the image im(φ) is a subgroup of H. The First Isomorphism Theorem states that G/ker(φ) ≅ im(φ), providing a fundamental link between quotients and subgroups. Isomorphisms are bijective homomorphisms, indicating that two groups are structurally identical. In Galois theory, field automorphisms preserving a base field form a group, and homomorphisms between Galois groups correspond to relationships between field extensions.</p>
<p>Group actions formalize how groups encode symmetries of objects. A group G acts on a set X if there is a map G × X → X, written g · x, such that e · x = x and (gh) · x = g · (h · x) for all g, h ∈ G and x ∈ X. Examples include Sₙ acting on {1, ..., n} by permutation, and the dihedral group Dₙ acting on a regular n-gon by rotations and reflections. Orbits partition X into equivalence classes moved into one another by the group, while stabilizers measure the symmetry of individual elements. In Galois theory, the Galois group acts on the roots of a polynomial, and the orbits correspond to algebraically indistinguishable roots. This action encodes precisely which algebraic relations hold among roots, translating the geometric intuition of symmetry into the rigorous language of group theory and revealing the hidden structure governing polynomial equations.</p>
