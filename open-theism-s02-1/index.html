<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis and Historical Development</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 1 · Interpreting Predictive Prophecy in Open Theism</p>
<article>
<p>Predictive prophecy presents one of the most significant challenges to Open Theism's denial of exhaustive divine foreknowledge. The Bible contains numerous predictions that appear to require God's knowledge of future free choices. The prophecy about Cyrus by name in Isaiah 44:28, written centuries before Cyrus was born, seems to demand that God foreknew the Persian king's decisions. Messianic prophecies detailing Christ's birthplace, manner of death, and the price of betrayal suggest meticulous foreknowledge of human actions. Open theists must address how their view accommodates these texts without resorting to the claim that biblical prophecy is unreliable or mistaken. Their responses involve distinguishing types of prophecy and offering alternative models of how prediction can work without requiring exhaustive foreknowledge of all future contingents.</p>

<p>One Open Theist strategy emphasizes that many prophecies are conditional rather than absolute. Jeremiah 18 explicitly states the principle: God announces intentions to build up or tear down nations, but if the nation changes its behavior, God changes the announced plan. The prophecy against Nineveh was not fulfilled because the city repented. Ezekiel contains prophecies against Tyre that seem not to have been completely fulfilled as predicted. Open theists argue that much predictive prophecy functions as divine warning or promise, contingent on human response. The purpose is not to demonstrate meticulous foreknowledge but to reveal God's character and intentions. God genuinely intends the predicted outcome but remains willing to modify plans based on creaturely response. Conditional prophecy requires foreknowledge of possibilities and probabilities, not of which possibility will actually be chosen.</p>

<p>A second approach distinguishes between predictions based on what God intends to bring about directly versus predictions dependent on free creaturely choices. When God announces something God will do, omnipotence ensures the prophecy's fulfillment. Prophecies about divine judgment, restoration, or the coming Messiah might primarily reflect God's resolute intentions rather than foreknowledge of contingent choices. God can guarantee that a Messiah will come, will be born in Bethlehem, and will suffer because God controls enough factors to ensure these outcomes regardless of particular human choices. Individual details—which couple would give birth to the Messiah, which governor would order census that brings them to Bethlehem, which individuals would betray and crucify him—need not be foreknown if God can work with whatever free choices occur to accomplish predetermined goals.</p>

<p>Open theists sometimes appeal to corporate election rather than individual foreknowledge to explain certain prophecies. God might know that someone from David's line will be Messiah without knowing which specific individual until closer to the event. The prophecy that Israel will be unfaithful might be based on God's perfect knowledge of probabilities given Israel's track record rather than certain foreknowledge of each individual's choices. This probabilistic model suggests God's predictions rest on unsurpassable wisdom about likelihoods. Given complete knowledge of all present factors, psychological tendencies, cultural patterns, and historical trajectories, God can predict with extremely high confidence without requiring metaphysical certainty. A prediction that is 99.99% likely based on perfect probabilistic knowledge serves prophetic purposes as well as certain foreknowledge would.</p>

<p>The possibility of self-fulfilling prophecy provides another explanatory resource. Once a prophecy is announced, it changes the situation. People respond to prophetic pronouncements, and those responses can contribute to the prophecy's fulfillment. If God predicts through Isaiah that a king named Cyrus will restore Israel, this prediction might influence Persian naming practices or encourage Israelites to recognize Cyrus when he appears. Not all prophecy works this way, but the phenomenon shows how divine speech can shape outcomes without requiring foreknowledge of independent choices. Critics charge that this makes prophecy manipulative; advocates respond that all divine communication influences those who hear it, and influence is not the same as coercion or determination.</p>

<p>Middle knowledge—God's knowledge of what free creatures would freely choose in any possible circumstance—offers a view that some open theists cautiously appropriate despite its association with Molinism. If God knows all counterfactuals about creaturely freedom, God can arrange circumstances to make certain outcomes highly likely or even certain without overriding freedom. By placing the right people in the right situations, God ensures prophecies come true while respecting libertarian freedom. Most open theists resist full Molinism because counterfactuals of freedom seem to require the very settled future their view denies. But limited use of middle knowledge for specific divine purposes, combined with God's ability to guarantee outcomes through providential arrangement of circumstances, might explain detailed prophecies without requiring exhaustive simple foreknowledge of all future facts.</p>

<p>The genre and purpose of prophetic literature matter for interpretation. Prophecy functions primarily to call people to repentance, to assure them of God's faithfulness, to warn of consequences, and to provide hope. The fulfillment of prediction serves to validate the prophet's message and demonstrate God's power and reliability. Even if some prophetic precision reflects literary shaping in hindsight—prophecy written during or after events it "predicts"—this need not imply deception if the genre is understood properly. Apocalyptic literature particularly operates with symbolic, non-literal imagery where "predictions" convey theological truths more than historical specifics. Open theists need not claim all prophecy was written after the fact, but recognizing genre conventions allows for nuanced reading. The debate ultimately concerns not whether God is powerful and reliable but what mechanisms best explain prophetic phenomena while preserving libertarian freedom and genuine openness.</p>
