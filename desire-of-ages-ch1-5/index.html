<header class="h"><h1>God With Us — Part 5: The Eternal Bond</h1><p class="intro">In taking our nature forever, the Son binds heaven and earth with a tie that cannot break.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Chapter 1 ends not at Bethlehem but in the heights of heaven. The astounding claim is that the incarnation is not a temporary costume for a rescue mission; it is an eternal commitment. The Son who was with God and is God becomes human without ceasing to be divine—and remains human, the “Son of Man,” enthroned. Humanity is not a ladder He climbs and descends; it is a nature He assumes and keeps. The pledge is permanent: God with us, now and forever.</p>
<p>This permanence secures our future. If a true Man shares the throne, then a place is prepared for human life at the very center of reality. Our weakness has an Advocate who understands from the inside; our worship has a Mediator whose wounds speak better than our words. The government of the universe includes, at its heart, a human heart. No creature need wonder whether the Holy One knows our frame; He has worn it, carries it, and dignifies it beyond imagining.</p>
<p>The bond also vindicates the mission. Satan sought to sever trust between God and His creatures; Christ not only restores it but overanswers the accusation by uniting the two in His own person. In Him, the family of heaven and the family of earth become kin. The distance that sin created is not merely spanned—it is transfigured into intimacy. The Redeemer’s glorified humanity becomes the everlasting reminder that God’s answer to rebellion was not annihilation but adoption.</p>
<p>Such solidarity changes how we live now. Bodies matter, time matters, place matters. The ordinary burdens of creaturehood—fatigue, tasks, tears—are not beneath the life of holiness, because they were not beneath the Holy One. To follow Jesus is to follow a path where divinity sanctifies the human, not by escape from earth but by faithful love upon it. Faithfulness in small things is cosmic, because the Man who reigns delights to call us brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Prayer, too, takes heart. We come not as applicants to a distant court but as children to an Elder Brother who brings us to the Father. His presence there is our welcome here. When conscience trembles, we remember that the One who judges is the One who saved, and that His judgment seat bears the marks of nails. Boldness grows where fear once crouched, because communion is the very business of the throne.</p>
<p>Finally, the eternal bond guarantees a universe safe from another fall. Having seen love unveiled in self-sacrifice, the loyal worlds and the redeemed will never again suspect the heart of God. The security of the ages rests not on force but on the beauty we have beheld in the Son who keeps our nature. The last word of the chapter becomes the first note of eternity: Immanuel—God with us.</p>
