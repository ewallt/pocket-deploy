<section class="p">
<p>When the Son came into a world bent on suspicion, He entered genuine peril. The cross was not staged inevitability but the price of authentic freedom. If creatures were to trust God voluntarily, they must be free to reject Him completely—even to the point of killing their Maker.</p>
<p>The incarnation thus reveals divine vulnerability. God stakes the credibility of His government on the honesty of His heart, not on invulnerability. Love, by nature, opens itself to risk. It cannot prove itself safe without ceasing to be love.</p>
<p>The cross shows that God valued freedom over self-preservation. He refused to end rebellion by force, choosing instead to meet deceit with disclosure. The risk was real: failure would have meant the collapse of creation’s moral coherence. Yet love considered it worth everything.</p>
<p>Even angels watched in awe. Power they understood; vulnerability they did not. The mystery of the cross widened heaven’s understanding of greatness: that true authority serves, and true glory bleeds.</p>
<p>In the risk of the cross, the universe learns that God’s rule depends not on control but on trust—and that He will stake His life to win it back.</p>
