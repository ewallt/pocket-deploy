<h1>Galois Theory: Structure and Examples</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 5 · Galois Groups of Specific Polynomials</p>
<article>
<p>Working through concrete examples solidifies understanding of Galois theory and reveals how abstract principles apply to specific polynomials. We examine several polynomials in detail, computing their splitting fields, Galois groups, and intermediate extensions. These examples illustrate techniques introduced earlier—discriminants, resolvent polynomials, and direct construction of automorphisms—while demonstrating the diversity of Galois groups that arise even for low-degree polynomials. Each example connects algebraic computation with group-theoretic structure, making the Fundamental Theorem tangible and operational.</p>
<p>Example 1: f(x) = x³ − 2 over ℚ. The roots are ∛2, ω∛2, and ω²∛2, where ω = e^{2πi/3} = (−1 + i√3)/2 is a primitive cube root of unity. The splitting field is K = ℚ(∛2, ω). We have [ℚ(∛2):ℚ] = 3 (minimal polynomial x³ − 2) and ω ∉ ℚ(∛2) (since ℚ(∛2) ⊂ ℝ but ω is complex), so [K:ℚ(∛2)] = 2 (minimal polynomial x² + x + 1 for ω). By the tower law, [K:ℚ] = 6. The Galois group Gal(K/ℚ) has order 6. Automorphisms are determined by where they send ∛2 (three choices: the three cube roots) and ω (two choices: ω or ω² = ω̅). Let σ: ∛2 ↦ ω∛2, ω ↦ ω, and τ: ∛2 ↦ ∛2, ω ↦ ω². Then Gal(K/ℚ) = ⟨σ, τ⟩ with σ³ = τ² = e and τστ⁻¹ = σ⁻¹, giving Gal(K/ℚ) ≅ S₃. Intermediate fields include ℚ(ω) (fixed by ⟨σ⟩ ≅ A₃) and ℚ(∛2) (not Galois over ℚ).</p>
<p>Example 2: f(x) = x⁴ − 2 over ℚ. The roots are ⁴√2, i⁴√2, −⁴√2, −i⁴√2, where ⁴√2 denotes the real fourth root. The splitting field is K = ℚ(⁴√2, i). We have [ℚ(⁴√2):ℚ] = 4 and [K:ℚ(⁴√2)] = 2 (adjoining i), so [K:ℚ] = 8. Automorphisms send ⁴√2 to any of the four fourth roots and i to ±i. Define σ: ⁴√2 ↦ i⁴√2, i ↦ i, and τ: ⁴√2 ↦ ⁴√2, i ↦ −i. Then σ⁴ = e, τ² = e, and τστ⁻¹ = σ⁻¹. This is the dihedral group D₄ of order 8, the symmetry group of a square. Intermediate fields correspond to subgroups of D₄: for instance, ℚ(i) (fixed by rotations ⟨σ⟩), ℚ(√2) (fixed by a subgroup of index 4), and ℚ(i√2) (another quadratic extension). The lattice of subfields mirrors the subgroup lattice of D₄, a non-abelian group illustrating rich structure.</p>
<p>Example 3: f(x) = x⁴ − 5x² + 6 over ℚ. Factoring, f(x) = (x² − 2)(x² − 3), so the roots are ±√2, ±√3. The splitting field is K = ℚ(√2, √3), which has degree 4 over ℚ (basis {1, √2, √3, √6}). Automorphisms fix ℚ and permute the roots. Let σ: √2 ↦ −√2, √3 ↦ √3, and τ: √2 ↦ √2, √3 ↦ −√3. Then Gal(K/ℚ) = ⟨σ, τ⟩ ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂, the Klein four-group V₄, an abelian group. Intermediate fields are ℚ(√2), ℚ(√3), and ℚ(√6), each quadratic over ℚ. This example shows that even reducible polynomials can have interesting Galois groups when considering their full splitting fields. The abelian structure reflects that the extension is built from independent quadratic layers.</p>
<p>Example 4: f(x) = x⁵ − x − 1 over ℚ. This polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstein after checking that it has no rational roots and reducing modulo primes shows irreducibility. The splitting field has degree divisible by 5. Computing the discriminant (a tedious calculation) shows it is not a perfect square, implying Gal(K/ℚ) is not contained in A₅. Analysis of cycle types using reductions modulo primes reveals that Gal(K/ℚ) = S₅, the full symmetric group on five elements, with order 120. This group is not solvable (it contains A₅, a simple non-abelian group), so x⁵ − x − 1 is not solvable by radicals. No formula involving only radicals and arithmetic operations expresses the roots, confirming the impossibility foreseen by Abel and Galois. This example is a canonical demonstration of an insolvable quintic.</p>
<p>Example 5: f(x) = x⁵ − 2 over ℚ. The roots are ⁵√2 · ζ₅ᵏ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, where ζ₅ = e^{2πi/5}. The splitting field is K = ℚ(⁵√2, ζ₅). We have [ℚ(⁵√2):ℚ] = 5 and [K:ℚ(⁵√2)] = φ(5) = 4 (since ζ₅ ∉ ℚ(⁵√2) ⊂ ℝ and the minimal polynomial of ζ₅ over ℚ has degree 4). Thus, [K:ℚ] = 20. Automorphisms send ⁵√2 to any fifth root (5 choices) and ζ₅ to ζ₅ᵏ with gcd(k,5)=1 (4 choices), but not all combinations are automorphisms. The Galois group is a Frobenius group of order 20, denoted F₂₀, a semidirect product ℤ₅ ⋊ ℤ₄. This group is solvable: it has a normal subgroup ℤ₅ with quotient ℤ₄, both cyclic hence abelian. Therefore, x⁵ − 2 is solvable by radicals, consistent with explicit formulas involving fifth roots and fourth roots of unity. This contrasts sharply with x⁵ − x − 1, showing that solvability depends crucially on the specific polynomial, not just degree.</p>
<p>Example 6: f(x) = x⁴ + 1 over ℚ. The roots are the eighth roots of unity ζ₈, ζ₈³, ζ₈⁵, ζ₈⁷ where ζ₈ = e^{πi/4} = (1+i)/√2. The splitting field is K = ℚ(ζ₈), a cyclotomic extension. The degree is φ(8) = 4, and Gal(K/ℚ) ≅ (ℤ/8ℤ)* ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ ≅ V₄, the Klein four-group. Automorphisms send ζ₈ to ζ₈ᵏ for k ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7}, and the group operation reflects multiplication modulo 8. Intermediate fields correspond to subgroups of V₄: the unique subfield of degree 2 is ℚ(i) (fixed by the subgroup mapping ζ₈ ↦ ζ₈⁻¹). This example ties together cyclotomic extensions and reducible quartics, illustrating that Galois groups encode deep structural information even when explicit roots are known. The abelian nature of the group guarantees solvability by radicals, here via quadratic and biquadratic extensions.</p>
<p>These examples span a range of behaviors: reducible and irreducible polynomials, solvable and insolvable groups, abelian and non-abelian structures. They demonstrate computational techniques (finding splitting fields, constructing automorphisms, identifying groups) and theoretical insights (solvability criteria, intermediate field correspondence). Mastering such examples bridges the gap between abstract Galois theory and practical problem-solving, enabling one to analyze any polynomial's Galois group and extract the algebraic and geometric information it encodes. Through these concrete illustrations, Galois theory transforms from an elegant abstraction into a powerful, actionable tool.</p>
