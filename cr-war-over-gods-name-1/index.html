<section class="p">
<p>The first fracture in the universe was not a broken rule but a broken picture of God. A created mind began to imagine that power, not love, defines divinity. If God’s greatness rests on control, then freedom looks like threat and loyalty becomes a currency to be traded. Suspicion entered where gratitude had once been effortless.</p>
<p>Rebellion grows by questions that sound wise but distrust intent. “Does God really seek your good?” becomes the seed of every later grief. The lie changes how we see ourselves, too: from children to competitors, from partners to pawns. The world shifts when the Father is viewed as rival rather than giver.</p>
<p>The garden story names this logic with simplicity. The fruit is desirable because distrust has already rewritten reality. The promise of becoming “like God” hides a deeper insult: that God hoards divinity instead of sharing it. The hand that reaches is driven less by appetite than by anxiety.</p>
<p>Heaven’s response is strikingly patient. Instead of crushing dissent, God lets character be tested in the open. Truth does not fear examination; love invites witnesses. The long timeline of redemption is not divine indecision but divine pedagogy—teaching creatures how to tell a lie from the truth.</p>
<p>The result is a universe placed in a classroom rather than a courtroom. Evidence will be gathered, not to satisfy God, but to persuade doubting hearts. Authority will prove itself by faithfulness over time, not by silencing questions with force.</p>
<p>Every story that follows—covenants, prophets, incarnation—unfolds this lesson. The war began in the imagination; it will be won there too, when faces turn again to trust the Name that was maligned.</p>
