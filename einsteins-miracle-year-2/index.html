    <h1>Space, Time, and E = mc²</h1>
    <p>How simultaneity became relative, clocks and rods shrank and stretched, and mass turned out to be bottled energy.</p>
  </header>
  <section class="p">
    <p>Einstein’s June 1905 paper on electrodynamics of moving bodies began from a simple demand: the laws of physics, including Maxwell’s equations, should look the same to all observers moving at constant velocity. Rather than postulate an ether wind to reconcile light’s behavior, he reexamined how we synchronize clocks and define simultaneity. Two lightning strikes “at the same time” for one observer need not be simultaneous for another in motion, and that recognition dissolves paradoxes without auxiliary machinery.</p>
    <p>From this redefinition flow the Lorentz transformations as kinematics rather than as dynamical distortions of an ether. Moving clocks tick more slowly and moving rulers contract along their direction of motion, not because of mechanical stress but because spacetime intervals mix time and space differently for different inertial frames. These effects are reciprocal and measurable, yet they preserve a deeper invariance: the spacetime interval remains the same for all inertial observers.</p>
    <p>The theory’s predictions quickly clarified puzzles. The null result of the Michelson–Morley interferometer experiment no longer cried out for contrivances; it was expected. Charged particles in beams behaved consistently with relativistic momentum and energy. Even the addition of velocities required revision: combining high speeds approaches, but never exceeds, the speed of light, ensuring a universal limit built into the fabric of measurement itself.</p>
    <p>A brief follow-up note that autumn asked what energy conservation implies for the inertia of a body that emits light. If a body radiates energy <em>E</em>, its mass must decrease by <em>E</em>/<em>c</em><sup>2</sup>, or conversely, a resting body embodies energy <em>E</em>=<em>mc</em><sup>2</sup>. The relation was not a recipe for weapons but a bookkeeping identity tying mass to energy content. Only later did technology exploit the equivalence in reactors and bombs; in 1905 it served to complete the symmetry of the new mechanics.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, the 1905 relativity program replaced absolute time with a network of operational procedures: how we compare distant clocks, exchange light signals, and define simultaneity. It is not that time “slows down” as a universal process; rather, different observers slice spacetime differently, yielding distinct but internally consistent accounts of durations and lengths. That shift reoriented physics from background structures to measurable invariants.</p>
    <p>Reception was uneven. Some experimentalists welcomed cleaner explanations; others hesitated at the cost to common sense. Within a decade, evidence accumulated, from fast electrons in cathode rays to precision spectroscopy, nudging the community toward acceptance. Einstein himself would extend the principle to accelerated motion and gravity, but the 1905 work already showed how far one can go by treating principles, not mechanisms, as the guide.</p>
    <p>Looking back, the miracle year tied three threads into the twentieth century’s loom. Quanta seeded quantum mechanics; Brownian motion secured atoms and statistical thinking; special relativity redefined kinematics and energy. The patent clerk’s method—start with clear principles, respect experiment, and accept surprising consequences—proved as transformative as any particular equation. It remains a model for intellectual courage tethered to empirical discipline.</p>
