      <h1>1888, the Latter Rain, and the Loud Cry: Preparing for Christ's Coming</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">The gospel message that ripens a people for the harvest</p>
      <p class="thesis">
        The 1888 message of Christ's righteousness was intended to be the beginning of the latter rain and loud cry, initiating the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit needed to complete God's work before the Second Coming. Ellen White testified that this message was God's appointed means to ripen a people for the harvest, leading them to deeper repentance and heart conversion that would open the way for the Spirit to work more fully in and through the church. The reception or rejection of this message directly affects the timing and progress of the final work—resistance shut away the special power of the Holy Spirit that God longed to impart, delaying the fullness of the intended blessing. The gospel, rightly understood and centered on Christ's righteousness, is not peripheral but central to preparation for the Second Coming. True readiness comes not through intensified law-keeping or fear-based religion but through receiving Christ by faith, which produces love, obedience, and Christlike character as its fruit. This message demonstrates how Adventist distinctives find their meaning and power when rooted in the gospel rather than standing apart from it.

              <p>The latter rain is not merely more power added to unchanged hearts, but the Spirit's fuller work in those who have received Christ by faith, enabling them to reflect His character and proclaim His righteousness with supernatural effectiveness.</p>

              <strong>"The Latter Rain Is Just More Power with the Same Message"</strong>
              <p>This misses the point that the latter rain requires the right message—Christ's righteousness—not merely intensified preaching of law and prophecy. Power comes when the gospel is central.</p>

              <strong>"The Delay Is Only About World Events"</strong>
              <p>While global conditions matter, Ellen White taught that the church's unreadiness—specifically resistance to the 1888 message—has prolonged the wait, making spiritual factors primary.</p>

              <strong>"Character Perfection Comes by Striving Harder"</strong>
              <p>The 1888 message corrects this by showing that Christlikeness grows through faith and abiding, not through intensified self-effort or fear-based religion.</p>

              <strong>"Adventist Distinctives Compete with the Gospel"</strong>
              <p>The truth is that Sabbath, sanctuary, and prophecy find their meaning within the gospel, expressing Christ's lordship rather than standing as tests divorced from grace.</p>

              <strong>"We Can Hasten the Coming by Better Obedience"</strong>
              <p>While readiness matters, hastening comes through receiving Christ by faith and allowing the Spirit to work, not through anxious attempts to perfect ourselves independently of grace.</p>
