<header class="h"><h1>The Temple Cleansed Again — Part 3: Children Cry “Hosanna”</h1><p class="intro">After tables fall and healing begins, the loudest theologians are children—teaching the temple how to sing again.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The newly quiet court fills with a different noise: small voices. What profiteers had drowned in bargaining, children restore with praise. “Hosanna to the Son of David!” They borrow the city’s procession hymn and bring it inside the house, unafraid to name the Healer as King. Their unstudied doxology interprets the moment more accurately than the authorities’ cross-examination. Joy recognizes authority sooner than anxiety does.</p>
<p>Leaders object, of course. They know how words work, where titles belong, what phrases are safe. “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus answers with Scripture that outranks their etiquette: “Out of the mouth of babes… You have perfected praise.” The quotation reframes the scene as fulfillment, not faux pas. If truth governs the temple, then the uncredentialed may lead its liturgy.</p>
<p>Children praise because they sense what grown fears complicate: that holiness is good news for the small. In a space where the lame have just been welcomed, the young feel at home. They are not auditioning. They are echoing kindness they can see and touch, and their echo becomes the day’s clearest theology. When love is near, speech loosens into gratitude.</p>
<p>There is rebuke hidden in the music. The same tongues that could not be hired to hawk doves freely honor the Lord who refuses to sell access to God. Praise exposes what turned the court into a market—scarcity, suspicion, control—and offers an alternative economy: abundance, trust, gift. The temple has not been emptied; it has been repurposed for its native sound.</p>
<p>Communities shaped by this scene will make room for childlike clarity. They will expect accurate theology to arrive sometimes in small sentences from small mouths, and they will refuse to hush gratitude until it fits adult taste. They will design worship that the weak can carry and the young can remember, because truth meant to be lived must also be singable.</p>
<p>Finally, the children prepare us for the week to come. Their “Hosanna” is rehearsal for a cross where the King will triumph by losing, and for a resurrection that will keep emptying the graveyard of our cynicism. If we can learn this song in the temple, we may recognize its melody in darker rooms—and keep singing.</p>
