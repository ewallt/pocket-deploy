<h1>The Cross as Evidence</h1>
<p class="intro">The cross is not a transaction but a testimony—the moment when God let the universe see what He is truly like.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
<p>The cross was not arranged to satisfy a legal formality. It was a revelation meant to bring the case to light before every watching mind. When deceit had framed God as arbitrary and cruel, only a demonstration of the opposite could settle the matter. The cross stands as the clearest evidence that God would rather bear suffering Himself than inflict it on His children.</p>
<p>No coercion is seen there. The Creator yields to His creatures, allowing hatred to exhaust its fury without retaliation. Power is present, yet restrained; strength is revealed in the refusal to destroy. The silence of divine endurance speaks more loudly than the noise of armies.</p>
<p>Each act in that drama overturns a falsehood. If the charge was that God demands the service of fear, the response is that He serves instead. If He was accused of being unwilling to forgive, His forgiveness is extended even to those hammering the nails. If He was said to rule by threats, the cross shows Him absorbing the worst that sin can do while still desiring reconciliation.</p>
<p>The scene exposes two incompatible kingdoms: one built on accusation, the other on truth and love. The difference could not have been clarified by words alone. Only when the contrast was embodied could the watching universe decide where reality resides. The verdict belongs not to intimidation but to understanding.</p>
<p>Thus the cross is the courtroom’s decisive exhibit. It answers the questions that began before our world existed, proving that divine authority is moral, not manipulative. Every being who sees the meaning of that day is convinced that love, not power, holds the throne.</p>
<p>Through that evidence the case is won—not by domination, but by revelation that no honest heart can deny.</p>
