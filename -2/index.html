<h1>Truth, Not Power</h1>
<p class="intro">In a universe of free beings, only truth can win lasting peace. Power can compel obedience, but never trust.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
<p>God’s response to accusation was not thunder but transparency. He chose to let the facts speak for themselves, opening His character and government to examination. This self-exposure is the opposite of domination—it is the humility of a ruler who invites judgment to restore confidence through evidence, not intimidation.</p>
<p>In every age He has demonstrated His reliability “in many and various ways.” Prophets told His story, yet He never forced belief. The freedom to doubt was preserved, because love without choice is an illusion. Only by risking rejection could God make genuine trust possible.</p>
<p>The decisive issue is always: who tells the truth? Words alone are not proof. Even falsehood can mimic devotion. Only through long and consistent demonstration—through patience, mercy, and integrity—can one’s trustworthiness be confirmed. God’s record, not His power, is His answer.</p>
<p>Every act of coercion would only strengthen suspicion. The more He forced, the less He would be believed. Therefore, He allows the process to unfold in history, letting time itself testify to the unchanging goodness of His ways. The universe watches, not to see who wins, but to see what love does when it is challenged.</p>
<p>God’s strength lies in truth lived out, not in threats carried out. His rule is persuasive, not repressive. He wins not by might, but by the unassailable consistency of His character—truth revealed through patient evidence, until no honest being can doubt again.</p>
