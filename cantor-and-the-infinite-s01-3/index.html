<h1>Cantor and the Infinite: Revolutionizing Numbers</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · One-to-One Correspondence: Comparing Sizes</p>
<article>
<p>How can we compare the sizes of two sets? For finite sets, the answer is straightforward: count the elements. A set with three elements is smaller than a set with five elements. But what about infinite sets? Counting infinitely many elements never terminates, so a different approach is needed. Cantor's breakthrough was to define size (or cardinality) in terms of one-to-one correspondence, also called bijection. Two sets have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them—a pairing where each element of one set matches exactly one element of the other, with no elements left over. This definition works for both finite and infinite sets, providing a rigorous foundation for comparing infinities.</p>

<p>A function f: A → B is a bijection if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Injective means distinct elements of A map to distinct elements of B: if f(a₁) = f(a₂), then a₁ = a₂. Surjective means every element of B is the image of some element of A: for all b ∈ B, there exists a ∈ A such that f(a) = b. A bijection pairs up A and B perfectly: every element of A has a unique partner in B, and vice versa. For finite sets, bijections exist only when the sets have the same number of elements. For infinite sets, bijections reveal surprising equivalences that defy intuition.</p>

<p>Consider the natural numbers ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} and the even natural numbers E = {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}. Intuitively, E seems "smaller" than ℕ because E is a proper subset of ℕ. However, Cantor showed they have the same cardinality by constructing a bijection: f(n) = 2n. This function pairs 0 ↔ 0, 1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 4, 3 ↔ 6, and so on. Every natural number n maps to a unique even number 2n, and every even number is the image of exactly one natural number (its half). Thus, despite E being a proper subset of ℕ, there are "as many" even numbers as natural numbers. This counterintuitive result is a hallmark of infinite sets: they can be in one-to-one correspondence with proper subsets of themselves.</p>

<p>Galileo Galilei observed a similar phenomenon in the 17th century, noting that there seem to be as many perfect squares {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...} as natural numbers, via the pairing n ↔ n². Galileo found this paradoxical and concluded that concepts like "greater than" or "less than" do not apply to infinite quantities. Cantor, however, embraced the paradox, using it to define what it means for infinite sets to have the same size. If a bijection exists, the sets have the same cardinality, even if one is a proper subset of the other. This was a radical conceptual shift: Cantor treated infinite sets as completed, actual objects that could be compared using precise mathematical criteria.</p>

<p>Cantor introduced the notation |A| to denote the cardinality of set A. Two sets A and B satisfy |A| = |B| if there exists a bijection between them. This relation is an equivalence relation: it is reflexive (|A| = |A|), symmetric (if |A| = |B|, then |B| = |A|), and transitive (if |A| = |B| and |B| = |C|, then |A| = |C|). Equivalence classes under this relation are called cardinal numbers. For finite sets, these coincide with the usual natural numbers: a set with three elements has cardinality 3. For infinite sets, Cantor introduced transfinite cardinal numbers, the smallest of which is aleph-null (ℵ₀), the cardinality of ℕ. Any set that can be put into bijection with ℕ has cardinality ℵ₀.</p>

<p>Cantor also defined an ordering on cardinalities. We say |A| ≤ |B| if there exists an injection (one-to-one function) from A to B. If |A| ≤ |B| and |B| ≤ |A|, then |A| = |B| (a result known as the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem, proven independently by several mathematicians). This theorem is non-trivial: constructing a bijection from two injections requires a clever argument. Cantor used this framework to show that some infinite sets are strictly larger than others. If |A| ≤ |B| but |A| ≠ |B|, we say |A| < |B|, meaning B is strictly larger. The power set P(ℕ) of natural numbers, for instance, has cardinality strictly greater than ℕ, a result proven by Cantor's diagonal argument.</p>

<p>One-to-one correspondence transformed the study of infinity from philosophical speculation to rigorous mathematics. Cantor's definition of cardinality via bijection provided a precise, objective criterion for comparing sets, applicable to any collection, finite or infinite. It revealed that infinity is not a single, monolithic concept but a hierarchy of different sizes, each with its own mathematical properties. This insight opened new vistas in mathematics, enabling the study of infinite-dimensional spaces, uncountable sets, and the foundations of analysis and topology. Cantor's method of comparing sizes through bijection remains central to modern set theory, providing the conceptual tools to navigate the infinite with confidence and clarity.</p>
