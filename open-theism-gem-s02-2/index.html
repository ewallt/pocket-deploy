<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis, History, and Key Debates</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 7 · Key Old Testament Texts: Divine Relenting and Openness</p>
<article>
<p>The Old Testament provides a significant body of textual evidence that Open Theists draw upon to support their view of a relational, responsive God. These passages, when read straightforwardly, depict God engaging with humanity in ways that suggest a future that is not exhaustively predetermined. The Hebrew verb *nāḥam*, often translated as "relent," "repent," or "change one's mind," is central to this discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Exodus 32:14</strong> is a paradigmatic example. After the Israelites create the golden calf, God declares His intention to destroy them and start a new nation with Moses. Moses intercedes passionately, appealing to God's reputation and promises. In response, the text says, "And the LORD relented (*nāḥam*) from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people." Open Theists see this as a genuine change in God's planned course of action, prompted by human prayer. The future was altered by Moses's intercession.</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 6:6-7</strong> describes God's reaction to human wickedness before the flood: "The LORD regretted (*nāḥam*) that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart." This language of regret suggests that the extent of human depravity was not a welcome or predetermined part of God's plan. It was an outcome that brought genuine sorrow to God, implying it was a tragic turn of events in an open history, not a scene from a meticulously crafted script.</p>
<p><strong>Jonah 3:10</strong> offers another clear case. God sends Jonah to prophesy Nineveh's destruction. The prophecy is unconditional in its wording. However, when the Ninevites repent, "When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented (*nāḥam*) of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it." This text highlights the conditional nature of prophetic warnings and shows God's plans being contingent on human actions.</p>
<p>Other passages suggest God's knowledge is dynamic. In <strong>Jeremiah 3:6-7</strong>, God recounts how He expected Israel to return to Him after witnessing Judah's unfaithfulness, saying, "I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but she did not return." This language of expectation and disappointment seems to portray a God who works with possibilities rather than certainties regarding future human choices. Similarly, God often "tests" people to "know" what is in their hearts (Deuteronomy 8:2, 2 Chronicles 32:31), implying a process of discovery.</p>
<p>While classical theologians interpret these texts as anthropopathic (ascribing human emotions to God), Open Theists argue that doing so consistently would mean ignoring a primary way the Old Testament presents God. They contend that these passages should be read as literal descriptions of a God who has chosen to enter into a genuine give-and-take relationship with His creation.</p>
