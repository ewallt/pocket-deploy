  <h1>Why God Went to Court</h1>
  <p class="intro">The central question was never who is strongest, but who tells the truth about reality and about God.</p>

<section class="p">
  <p>The courtroom motif pictures a universe watching a public case. The claims at issue concern God’s integrity: whether He governs by arbitrary power or by principles that respect freedom and invite trust. Every being is a juror of sorts, weighing not decrees but evidence. If the questions were about force, a display of might would have ended the matter at once—but it would have proved only that God can win, not that He is good.</p>
  <p>Coercion can secure compliance; it cannot produce confidence. Love cannot be commanded and still be love. That is why the response to accusation had to be open and patient, giving time for the facts to be seen. The goal is not to silence questions but to answer them so thoroughly that suspicion cannot take root again without dishonesty.</p>
  <p>The conflict reached our world when distrust entered the human heart. Lies about God painted Him as severe and self-serving, turning warning into threat and law into bondage. The tragedy was not merely the breaking of rules, but the breakdown of relationship. Healing, therefore, must repair trust, not just adjust status.</p>
  <p>To that end, God chose transparency over intimidation. He placed His character and government under examination, allowing history to expose what He is like under pressure. This openness is itself evidence: a ruler who invites scrutiny shows confidence in the truth and respect for the freedom of His family.</p>
  <p>The “court” thus exists for our sake, not because God is insecure. Its proceedings gather the record by which honest minds may decide. When the verdict rests on the weight of evidence, peace can endure without surveillance or fear. Such a universe is not merely controlled; it is convinced.</p>
  <p>That is why He “went to court”: to win by revelation what He refused to win by compulsion—trust freely given because truth has been seen. Only then can freedom be safe forever.</p>
