<h1>Open Theism: Core Tenets and Philosophical Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · Free Will and Divine Sovereignty</p>
<article>
<p>The relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom stands at the heart of Open Theist theology. Open theists affirm libertarian free will—the view that agents sometimes face genuinely open alternatives and possess the power to choose among them such that they could have done otherwise in the exact same circumstances. This contrasts with compatibilist accounts, which define freedom as acting according to one's desires without external constraint, allowing that free acts can be determined by prior causes. For open theists, only libertarian freedom makes sense of moral responsibility, the meaningfulness of choice, and the authenticity of relationships. Without the genuine possibility of doing otherwise, praise and blame become hollow, and human actions become mere effects of causal chains stretching back to creation.</p>

<p>Critics often charge that Open Theism compromises divine sovereignty by limiting God's control over creation. Open theists respond by distinguishing sovereignty from meticulous determinism. God remains sovereign in the sense of being supreme in power, authority, and ultimate control over cosmic outcomes. However, sovereignty does not require micromanaging every detail. A sovereign who grants genuine freedom to creatures demonstrates greater power than one who must determine every action to achieve purposes. God's sovereignty, on this view, includes the power to create beings with libertarian freedom and the wisdom to accomplish divine goals while respecting that freedom. The risk of granting such freedom—that creatures might misuse it—makes creation more precarious but also more valuable.</p>

<p>Open Theism navigates between two extremes in the classical free will debate. Against Calvinistic determinism, which affirms that God foreordains all events including human choices, Open Theism insists on libertarian freedom as necessary for authentic moral agency. Against Pelagian views that minimize divine involvement, Open Theism maintains that God actively works in history, responds to prayer, and guides events toward intended goals. The middle path involves God setting boundaries, creating circumstances, and working persuasively without coercively overriding free will. God influences but does not determine; limits but does not eliminate options; guides but does not drag. This requires a more dynamic, responsive model of providence than classical determinism allows but preserves more robust divine involvement than strict libertarianism might suggest.</p>

<p>The question of how God achieves purposes without controlling free choices receives various answers among open theists. Some emphasize God's perfect knowledge of probabilities—though God does not know which path a free agent will choose, God knows the likelihood of each option with perfect accuracy. By arranging circumstances optimally, God can make certain outcomes highly probable without making them certain. Others stress God's unsurpassable creativity in responding to whatever choices creatures make, always finding ways to advance divine purposes regardless of which branching paths history takes. Still others point to God's ability to set unbreakable constraints—establishing what cannot happen while leaving much open within those boundaries. These strategies combine to give God effective sovereignty without requiring exhaustive control.</p>

<p>The concept of risk emerges prominently in Open Theist discussions. If God grants libertarian freedom without knowing exactly how it will be exercised, then creation involves genuine risk. God's purposes might be frustrated, at least temporarily. Prayers might go unanswered not because God is unwilling but because circumstances shaped by free choices prevent the answer. Evil and suffering enter the world through creaturely choices that God permits but does not desire. Critics see this as unacceptably diminishing God's power and wisdom. Advocates argue it makes better sense of biblical narratives where God expresses disappointment, adjusts plans, and genuinely grieves over evil. The question becomes whether a God who takes risks out of love for freedom is more or less worthy of worship than a God who eliminates all risk through total control.</p>

<p>Open theists often appeal to the parent analogy to illustrate their view. Good parents grant children increasing freedom as they mature, even though that freedom creates risk of poor choices. Parents influence and guide but do not control, precisely because the goal is raising mature moral agents capable of authentic relationship. The parent who micromanages every detail may prevent harm but stunts development. Similarly, God's grant of libertarian freedom creates possibilities for both great good and great evil, but it serves the higher purpose of creating beings capable of genuine love, worship, and relationship. Love that is coerced or determined is not truly love. Freedom makes failure possible but also makes authentic relationship possible. Without freedom, humans would be divine puppets; with it, they can become God's friends.</p>

<p>The practical implications for Christian life are significant. If libertarian freedom is real, then human choices genuinely matter to the course of history. Believers carry real responsibility for their actions, not merely the appearance of responsibility while actually fulfilling a predetermined script. Evangelism and prayer become urgent tasks whose outcome depends partly on human response. The future remains open to influence by faithful action. This creates both empowerment—our choices matter—and burden—we cannot simply trust that "everything happens for a reason" in the sense of divine orchestration. Open theists believe this tension reflects biblical teaching more accurately than either fatalism about divine control or anxiety about God's weakness. God remains sovereign but exercises that sovereignty through invitation and persuasion more than through coercion and control.</p>
