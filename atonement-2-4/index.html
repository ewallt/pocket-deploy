<header class="h"><h1>The Vindication of God</h1><p class="intro">At Calvary, God answered every accusation with the evidence of love.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Maxwell described the cross as a courtroom in which God, not humanity, stood on trial. The charges were cosmic: Is God fair? Is He safe to trust with power? Calvary gave the decisive reply.</p>
<p>By enduring the full consequences of rebellion, God proved His innocence and His integrity. He did not defend Himself with power but with truth and suffering love.</p>
<p>Every question the universe could ask about God’s character was answered there. Justice and mercy were seen to be one and the same. No coercion was needed — truth itself won the case.</p>
<p>In this sense, atonement was for God as well as for us. It restored His reputation before those who had been misled. The cross is not God appeasing Himself but revealing Himself.</p>
<p>The final judgment is merely the public confirmation of that vindication. When every being acknowledges that God has been true and just, the controversy ends.</p>
<p>Calvary settled more than our salvation — it secured the moral safety of the universe forever.</p>
