          { id: 'why-water-follows-blood', title: 'Why Water Follows Blood', content: `<h4>A Liturgy in Motion</h4><p>The Exodus unfolds like a liturgy in motion: blood, then water, then word. On Passover night Israel is distinguished by the lambâs blood (Exod 12). That verdict is juridicalâa household is declared under Yahwehâs mercyâyet the people are still trapped between Pharaoh and the sea. What begins at the altar must be sealed at the laver. The Red Sea is that second act: an embodied passage that separates a nation from bondage and constitutes it as a priestly people.</p><h4>The Sanctuary and the Sea</h4><p>Scripture itself makes this connection. Psalm 77 pairs two crucial lines: âYour way, O God, is in the sanctuaryâ (v.13) and âYour way was in the seaâ (v.19). The same divine âwayâ that structures the sanctuary also structures the historical deliverance. The Red Sea, therefore, functions as the great laver in the Exodus drama, the cleansing and consecrating water that follows the atoning blood of the Passover altar.</p>` },
          { id: 'jurisdiction-shift', title: 'Jurisdiction Shift', content: `<h3>From Household to Nation</h3><p>The sequence from altar to laver represents a shift in status and jurisdiction. The Passover blood marks individual households for mercy, but the passage through the sea constitutes them as a corporate nation, publicly transferred from Pharaohâs dominion to Yahwehâs.</p><div class="impact-grid"><div class="impact-card"><h4>Corporate Consecration</h4><p>Paul interprets the event this way: âAll were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the seaâ (1 Cor 10:1â2). This is not about individual piety but corporate consecration. An entire people passes through the waters and emerges under a new covenant head.</p></div><div class="impact-card"><h4>Liberation Follows Justification</h4><p>The sequence is theologically crucial. Deliverance is more than forgiveness. The Passover blood shields from judgment (justification), but the sea breaks Pharaohâs claim (liberation). Baptism isn't about earning pardon; it publicly announces a transfer of lordship.</p></div><div class="impact-card"><h4>A Non-Violent Victory</h4><p>Israel does not defeat Egypt with weapons; God opens a way and then closes it. The crossing is not a military achievement but a national baptism. This forms an ethic: God's people are saved by a pathway, not by the sword.</p></div></div>` },
          { id: 'priestly-analogy-altar-laver', title: 'Priestly Analogy (AltarâLaver)', content: `<h3>A Blueprint for Ministry</h3><p>The layout of the Israelite sanctuary provides a clear blueprint for this theological sequence. The laver, the bronze basin of water, stood in the courtyard between the altar of burnt offering and the entrance to the holy place (Exod 30:17â21).</p><div class="figure-grid"><div class="figure-card"><h4>Blood First, Then Water</h4><p>Priests who were already covered by the atoning blood of the altar were still required to wash their hands and feet at the laver before they could enter the tent to minister before the Lord. The penalty for failing to do so was death.</p></div><div class="figure-card"><h4>Consecration for Service</h4><p>This demonstrates that the water of the laver was not for initial pardon but for consecration for service. It was the rite of passage that moved a priest from a state of being forgiven to a state of being fit for ministry.</p></div><div class="figure-card"><h4>Israel as a Priestly Nation</h4><p>Israel, as a whole, is called to be a "kingdom of priests" (Exod 19:6). The Red Sea crossing is their national priestly washing, consecrating them for the covenant service they will receive at Sinai.</p></div></div>` },
          { id: 'pauls-frame-1-cor-10-1-2', title: 'Paulâs Frame (1 Cor 10:1â2)', content: `<h4>A Typological Reading</h4><p>The Apostle Paul provides the key New Testament interpretation of the crossing. In his warning to the Corinthian church, he explicitly frames the event as a type of Christian baptism: "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea."</p><h4>Corporate Identity</h4><p>Paul's emphasis is on the corporate nature of the event. The word "all" is repeated five times. Just as the Corinthians were baptized into the one body of Christ, so the Israelites were collectively baptized "into Moses," their covenant mediator.

Just as Christian baptism is an initiation into the body of Christ, the Red Sea crossing was the event that formally transferred the people from the headship of Pharaoh to the headship of Moses, who represented God.

Pharaoh's model is imperial domination. He creates order through coercion, slavery, and violence. He controls his world by crushing dissent and extracting resources. Yahweh's model is creational. He creates order by making a path, by opening up a space for life to flourish. His victory at the sea is not won by arming Israel to defeat Egypt in battle, but by re-shaping the very fabric of the cosmos to create a way of escape.</p><h4>Salvation as a Pathway</h4><p>This reframes the very meaning of salvation. Salvation is not the transfer of power from one empire to another; it is the opening of a new way of being in the world. God's people are not called to become a new Pharaoh, but to walk the path that God provides.

To be baptized is to be united with Christ in His crucifixion and burial.</p><h4>A New Life</h4><p>But the story does not end in the tomb. Paul continues, "Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life" (Rom 6:4). Baptism is a death and a birth. It marks the definitive end of the old life, the old identity, the old allegiance to the powers of sin and death. At the same time, it marks the beginning of a new life, a new identity as a child of God, empowered to walk in the "newness of life" provided by the resurrection.</p>` },

For the disciples, who were mostly fishermen, the sea was their workplace, a source of both livelihood and danger. In the symbolic world of the Old Testament, however, the sea was much more: it was the realm of chaos, the untamed deep, the haunt of the dragon. When Jesus performs miracles on the sea, he is not just demonstrating power over nature; he is revealing himself as the Lord of creation, the one who has authority over the forces of chaos.</p><h4>An Exodus Reprise</h4><p>Many of Jesus' actions on and around the sea are deliberately staged as a reprise of the Exodus. He is presented as a new and greater Moses, leading a new Israel out of bondage. The sequence of his actionsâmastering the deep, providing bread in the wilderness (the feedings of the 5,000 and 4,000), and teaching on a mountainâdirectly mirrors the pattern of the original Exodus: Red Sea crossing, manna from heaven, and law at Sinai.</p>` },

Jesus, awakened from sleep, simply rebukes the wind and the sea with the words, "Peace! Be still!" The disciples are left in awe, asking, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" The answer, for a reader steeped in the Old Testament, is clear: only Yahweh, the Creator, can command the chaotic waters.</p></div><div class="impact-card"><h4>Walking on the Water</h4><p>In Mark 6, the disciples are again struggling against a storm. Jesus comes to them, walking on the sea. This is another act that the Old Testament attributes to God alone (Job 9:8). His words to the terrified disciplesâ"Take heart, it is I (*ego eimi*); do not be afraid"âuse the same divine "I AM" language God used with Moses at the burning bush.</p></div><div class="impact-card"><h4>The Gerasene Demoniac (Legion)</h4><p>In Mark 5, Jesus confronts a man possessed by a horde of demons named "Legion." After casting them out, he allows them to enter a herd of pigs, which then rush down a steep bank into the sea and are drowned.

His death and resurrection are framed as the ultimate descent into the chaotic deep and the triumphant return to the land of the living.</p><h4>A Paschal Crossing</h4><p>This connects his entire ministry back to the Exodus pattern. His death at Passover is the sacrifice of the true Paschal Lamb. His resurrection on the third day is the ultimate crossing of the seaâa passage through the waters of death itself.
