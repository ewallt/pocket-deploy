<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis and Historical Development</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · Key New Testament Texts on God's Knowledge</p>
<article>
<p>Jesus's lament over Jerusalem provides powerful support for the Open Theist reading. In Matthew 23:37, Jesus cries "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!" The language expresses divine longing that was frustrated by human unwillingness. Open theists argue this makes most sense if the future was genuinely open—God desired one outcome but Jerusalem's free rejection prevented it. If God foreknew their rejection from eternity, the lament seems disingenuous. Classical theists respond that Jesus genuinely desired their response while foreknowing they would refuse, experiencing authentic grief over what might have been. Open theists find this psychologically implausible—how can one genuinely long for an outcome one knows with certainty will not occur?</p>

<p>The Gospels present Jesus as lacking certain knowledge during his earthly ministry. Mark 13:32 records Jesus saying about his return, "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." If Jesus, as the incarnate Son, did not know the timing of his return, this suggests limitations on divine knowledge or at least on the knowledge available to God's human agent. Open theists see this as evidence that even God's own plans for the future involve undetermined elements. The timing depends on various contingencies in history and will be determined when the Father judges the moment is right. Classical theists typically attribute Jesus's limited knowledge to his human nature while maintaining that his divine nature possesses exhaustive foreknowledge. The question is whether incarnation theology allows this sharp division between what Jesus knows qua human and qua divine.</p>

<p>The New Testament's emphasis on prayer and its efficacy supports Open Theist claims. James 5:16 declares "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective," and James 4:2 states "You do not have because you do not ask." These texts suggest prayer accomplishes outcomes that would not occur without prayer. If all outcomes are already determined in God's exhaustive foreknowledge and eternal decree, in what sense does prayer change anything? Open theists argue their view makes straightforward sense of these exhortations—prayer genuinely influences God's decisions because those decisions involve responses to a partially open future. Classical theists respond that God ordains both means and ends together, so prayer is the ordained means to certain ends, genuinely causing them within God's providential plan. The debate concerns whether this preserves prayer's meaningfulness or renders it theatrical.</p>

<p>Paul's teaching on election and predestination in Romans 8-9 and Ephesians 1 presents challenges for Open Theism. Romans 8:29 states "For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son." Ephesians 1:11 declares God "works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will." These texts seem to affirm comprehensive divine foreknowledge and meticulous providence. Open theists offer several interpretive strategies. "Foreknowledge" might refer to God's relational knowing—choosing to enter covenant relationship—rather than cognitive knowing future facts. Corporate election means God predestined that there would be a church, a people conformed to Christ, without predestining which individuals would be included. "Everything" working according to God's will might be hyperbolic, meaning God accomplishes all intended purposes without controlling every detail. Critics find these readings exegetically strained, while advocates see them as legitimate alternatives to deterministic interpretations.</p>

<p>The portrayal of Jesus in Gethsemane shows him struggling with the Father's will, suggesting genuine decision-making rather than acting out a predetermined script. "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will" (Matthew 26:39) represents real wrestling with alternatives. Open theists see this as revealing that even the crucifixion, central to God's redemptive plan, involved libertarian freedom. Jesus could have refused; his obedience was genuine choice, not determined inevitability. The Father's will was the cross, but accomplishing it required the Son's free submission. This preserves the moral significance of Jesus's obedience. Classical theists agree Jesus's obedience was morally significant but typically maintain the outcome was certain given the divine decree, though Jesus's human will genuinely consented rather than being coerced.</p>

<p>First Peter 1:2 describes believers as "chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father." This could support either view depending on how "foreknowledge" is understood. If it means God's cognitive awareness of future facts including who will believe, it supports classical foreknowledge. If it means God's relational knowledge—choosing to enter saving relationship with those who respond in faith—it's compatible with Open Theism. The Greek "prognosis" can carry either sense. Open theists point to texts like Romans 11:2 where "foreknowledge" seems to mean God's covenant choice rather than mere precognition. The exegetical question is whether New Testament foreknowledge language inherently requires exhaustive divine awareness of future contingents or whether it primarily emphasizes God's purposive activity and relational initiative in salvation.</p>

<p>The New Testament's apocalyptic visions in Revelation present complex interpretive issues. The detailed predictions about end times events might seem to require exhaustive foreknowledge. Open theists respond by emphasizing apocalyptic genre conventions involving symbolic rather than literal prediction, God's own intentions for the future that don't depend on undetermined human choices, and the possibility that much apocalyptic material describes general patterns rather than specific events. The key theological message of Revelation concerns God's sovereignty and ultimate victory over evil, Christ's lordship, and encouragement for persecuted believers. These themes don't require every detail to be eternally predetermined. What matters is that God will accomplish redemptive purposes and establish justice, however contingent the specific historical path proves to be. The vision provides assurance of God's ultimate control without requiring meticulous foreknowledge of all interim developments.</p>
