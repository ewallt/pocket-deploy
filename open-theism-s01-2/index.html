<h1>Open Theism: Core Tenets and Philosophical Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · God's Knowledge and the Open Future</p>
<article>
<p>The philosophical foundation of Open Theism rests on a particular understanding of divine omniscience and the nature of future contingents. Classical theism defines God's omniscience as knowledge of all true propositions, including propositions about future events. Open theists accept this definition but add a crucial qualification: future contingent propositions—statements about free choices not yet made—lack determinate truth values and therefore cannot be known even by an omniscient being. This is not a limitation on God's power or knowledge but a recognition of logical impossibility. Just as God cannot create square circles because the concept is incoherent, God cannot know as settled what is genuinely undecided. Omniscience means knowing all that is knowable, not knowing logical impossibilities.</p>

<p>To understand this claim requires distinguishing different types of future events. Some future occurrences are determined by present causes and natural laws—the sun will rise tomorrow, for instance. God knows these futures exhaustively because they follow necessarily from present conditions that God perfectly apprehends. Other futures depend on God's own intentions, which God obviously knows with certainty. The problematic category involves futures contingent on libertarian free choices. If human beings possess genuine freedom to do otherwise—if their choices are not determined by prior causes—then propositions about those choices lack truth value until the moment of decision. A proposition like "Jones will freely choose coffee tomorrow" is neither true nor false today, according to Open Theism. It becomes true only when Jones makes the choice.</p>

<p>This position engages with classical debates about future contingents stretching back to Aristotle's famous sea battle argument. Aristotle questioned whether the proposition "there will be a sea battle tomorrow" is true today if the battle has not yet occurred and depends on free choices. Open theists follow one interpretation of Aristotle in denying bivalence for such statements—they have no truth value until the event occurs. Classical theism, following thinkers like Boethius and Aquinas, typically responded by appeal to God's eternal perspective, from which all temporal moments are simultaneously present. God knows future contingents not by predicting them but by directly perceiving them in an eternal "now." Open theists reject this solution, arguing that it collapses the distinction between past, present, and future in ways that contradict biblical portrayals and human experience of temporal flow.</p>

<p>The concept of presentism plays a significant role in Open Theist metaphysics. Presentism is the view that only present entities exist; the past no longer exists, and the future does not yet exist. On this view, there are no future facts to be known because there is no future realm of being. God knows the past as determinate, the present exhaustively, and the future as a realm of possibilities rather than actualities. God's knowledge includes perfect understanding of probability distributions over possible futures, complete awareness of all causal tendencies, and infallible judgment about which outcomes are more or less likely. Some open theists describe this as God possessing maximal knowledge of a partially open future—knowing everything that can be known given the ontological structure of reality.</p>

<p>Critics object that this view unacceptably limits divine omniscience. If God does not know whether Jones will choose coffee or tea tomorrow, they argue, then there is something God does not know, contradicting biblical affirmations of God's comprehensive knowledge. Open theists respond by questioning what "knowing the future" means. They distinguish between knowing future possibilities and knowing future actualities. God knows all possible futures perfectly, understands every branching pathway through decision trees, and perceives every relevant factor bearing on likelihood. What God does not know is which possibility will be actualized by a free choice not yet made. This is not ignorance but recognition that there is nothing yet to be known. The proposition lacks a truth-maker, not God's knowledge lacks comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>The practical implications of this view shape Open Theist approaches to prayer and providence. If future free choices are genuinely open, then petitionary prayer makes robust sense—prayers can influence outcomes because those outcomes are not yet settled. God can respond to prayers by adjusting intentions, modifying plans, or working in new ways precisely because the future contains multiple possibilities. Providence becomes less like the execution of a detailed blueprint and more like wise navigation of a partially uncharted course. God knows the destination and possesses unsurpassable skill in bringing it about, but the precise route involves genuine contingencies. Some critics worry this makes providence precarious, while advocates argue it makes prayer and relationship authentic rather than theatrical.</p>

<p>The Open Theist account of divine knowledge has generated sophisticated philosophical debates about the logic of omniscience. Some philosophers defend "open future" logics that formalize reasoning about indeterminate futures, developing semantic systems where future contingents receive neither "true" nor "false" but some third value or no value at all. Others argue that omniscience entails a kind of "super-knowledge" that transcends the limitations of standard propositional knowledge. The debate connects to broader questions in philosophy of time, free will, and the nature of truth. Open theists see their position as philosophically defensible, exegetically grounded, and existentially satisfying, while critics view it as an unwarranted capitulation to philosophical pressures that compromises essential divine attributes.</p>
