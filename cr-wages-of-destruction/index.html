    "display_name": "Unit 1",
    "paragraphs": [
      {
        "heading": "The Fragile Foundations of Nazi Ambition",
        "content": "When Hitler came to power in 1933, he promised to restore German strength through rapid rearmament. Yet the Nazi state inherited an economy battered by the Depression, short of raw materials, and dependent on foreign imports for vital supplies like oil and rubber. Tooze shows that rearmament was launched on shaky financial ground, funded by credit schemes and deficit spending rather than sustainable growth. This meant that every step forward deepened Germany’s reliance on conquest to keep the system afloat. The promise of a self-sufficient fortress Germany was never realistic. Instead, the regime was locked into a cycle of expansion to feed its war machine."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Limits of Autarky",
        "content": "Nazi ideology emphasized autarky—economic self-sufficiency—but geography and resources made this impossible. Germany produced coal and steel in abundance, but it lacked oil, rubber, and key metals like chromium. Efforts to substitute synthetic fuels and ersatz materials were impressive but costly and never enough to meet military needs. By 1939, Germany still depended heavily on imports, many of which came from the very countries it would soon invade. Tooze underscores that the dream of autarky was less a reality than a propaganda claim. In practice, the German economy was a patchwork of shortages, forcing Hitler to see expansion as the only solution."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Rearmament on Credit",
        "content": "The Nazi state financed rearmament through creative but dangerous fiscal maneuvers. Mefo bills, essentially promissory notes guaranteed by the state, allowed armaments firms to be paid without immediate cash. This concealed the growing debt from the public but could not hide the underlying imbalance. The economy was overheated, with inflationary pressures rising and consumer goods scarce. By the late 1930s, rearmament had created impressive armed forces but at the cost of exhausting Germany’s financial reserves. The system could not be sustained indefinitely, which made war not only an ideological goal but an economic necessity."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Four-Year Plan",
        "content": "In 1936, Hitler unveiled the Four-Year Plan to prepare Germany for war and reduce its reliance on imports. Hermann Göring was put in charge, reflecting Hitler’s belief that only political will could overcome economic limits. The plan pushed synthetic fuel production, expanded armaments, and redirected labor toward military industries. Yet the goals consistently outstripped results. Tooze argues that the Four-Year Plan reveals the contradictions of the regime: it aimed at both preparing for a long war and rushing toward short-term confrontation. The economy was never ready for prolonged conflict, but political urgency demanded rapid mobilization."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Civilian Sacrifices",
        "content": "To fuel rearmament, German civilians bore the cost. Consumer goods were restricted, food was rationed, and living standards stagnated. Nazi propaganda emphasized sacrifice for the national struggle, portraying shortages as patriotic duty. While this was tolerated during the 1930s, it created tensions that would deepen during the war. Tooze emphasizes that the Nazi economy was not the efficient, streamlined machine of myth. It was a system of trade-offs, where civilian needs were constantly squeezed to keep the military supplied. The price of Hitler’s ambition was paid daily in the shops and kitchens of ordinary Germans."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Illusion of Economic Strength",
        "content": "To outsiders, Nazi Germany looked formidable by the late 1930s, boasting rapid growth and a vast army. Yet Tooze demonstrates that this strength was precarious. The state was juggling debt, managing shortages, and relying on imports even as it boasted of independence. The apparent economic miracle was built on fragile foundations, and German leaders knew it. Hitler’s push for expansion was in part an acknowledgment that the Reich could not survive indefinitely within its borders. War was not simply chosen for ideological reasons—it was driven by material necessity."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Why Economic Limits Mattered",
        "content": "Understanding Germany’s economic constraints is key to understanding why it pursued such aggressive policies. Tooze shows that the decision to rearm at breakneck speed locked the regime into a path where only conquest could resolve its deficits. Each step of the way, from credit schemes to autarky campaigns, deepened the urgency to act before economic weakness became unmanageable. Hitler’s timetable for war was not arbitrary; it was shaped by the realities of what the economy could and could not support. The Nazi state was, in effect, running against the clock."
      },
      {
        "heading": "A War Born of Weakness",
        "content": "Rather than being an unstoppable juggernaut, Nazi Germany was a power gambling on war to solve its economic crisis. This is Tooze’s central insight: the regime’s aggression was born less from strength than from weakness. Hitler launched the most destructive conflict in history while knowing that time was not on Germany’s side. Rearmament without resources created the illusion of power, but it could only be sustained through conquest. The contradiction between ambition and capacity would define the entire course of the war and ultimately lead to Germany’s downfall."

    "name": "Unit 2: Expansion and the Logic of Conquest",
    "display_name": "Unit 2",
    "paragraphs": [
      {
        "heading": "The Drive for Lebensraum",
        "content": "At the heart of Hitler’s vision was the idea of Lebensraum—living space for the German people. This was not just ideology but a blueprint for solving Germany’s economic problems. Eastern Europe, with its farmland, oil, and raw materials, was seen as the prize that would secure self-sufficiency. Tooze emphasizes that the decision to invade Poland and later the Soviet Union was rooted in this economic logic as much as in racial doctrine. The conquest of land was expected to feed the German war machine and provide the resources to withstand a long struggle against Britain and the United States."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Economic Motives Behind War",
        "content": "Germany’s wars of aggression were not only ideological but economic gambles. By seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia, Hitler gained industrial bases, gold reserves, and military equipment. The dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1939 gave Germany access to the Skoda armaments works, strengthening its military power. Each conquest was expected to pay for itself, supplying resources and reducing dependence on imports. Tooze makes clear that Nazi expansion was driven by the belief that only conquest could close the gap between ambition and capacity. War was seen as the only route to economic survival."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Exploitation of Conquered Territories",
        "content": "Once conquest began, exploitation followed. Occupied countries were forced to pay reparations, supply food, and deliver raw materials to the Reich. France, the Netherlands, and Belgium were drained to feed the German economy. In Eastern Europe, the exploitation was even more brutal, with deliberate policies of starvation and requisition. The conquered territories became both lifelines and laboratories of Nazi policy, as ideology and economics intertwined. Tooze stresses that the German economy was propped up by systematic looting, which delayed but could not prevent eventual collapse."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Soviet Gamble",
        "content": "The invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was the most dramatic expression of the logic of conquest. Germany needed the oil of the Caucasus, the grain of Ukraine, and the vast raw materials of the East. Hitler expected a quick victory that would secure these resources permanently. Instead, the campaign bogged down, and the gamble failed. The hoped-for windfall turned into a drain, with German forces overextended and supply lines collapsing. Tooze argues that this failure sealed Germany’s fate: the war that was supposed to solve its economic problems instead magnified them beyond repair."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Human Cost of Expansion",
        "content": "The pursuit of conquest was inseparable from Nazi racial ideology. Slavic populations were seen as expendable, their land to be seized for German settlers. The Hunger Plan envisioned millions of Soviet citizens starving so that German soldiers and civilians could be fed. Forced labor became routine, with millions deported to Germany to work in factories under brutal conditions. Expansion was thus both an economic strategy and a crime against humanity. Tooze shows how ideology provided the justification, while economic need provided the urgency."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Temporary Gains and Long-Term Weakness",
        "content": "Conquest initially brought windfalls. Gold, food, and industrial capacity from Austria, Czechoslovakia, and France boosted the German economy in the short term. But in the long run, occupation created new burdens. Resistance movements disrupted production, and maintaining garrisons consumed manpower. The Soviet failure turned conquest into a drain rather than a solution. The gap between Nazi ambition and actual resources widened rather than narrowed. Expansion bought time, but it could not solve the underlying weakness of the Reich."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Why Conquest Failed",
        "content": "Tooze concludes that conquest could never deliver the security Hitler sought. Occupied Europe could not be fully harnessed, and the resources of the Soviet Union proved unattainable. The dream of an autarkic empire collapsed under the realities of geography, resistance, and Allied pressure. Conquest postponed collapse but did not prevent it. In the end, the very logic that drove Nazi expansion—plunder as survival—ensured that the regime was always living on borrowed time. The gamble of war had no sustainable outcome."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Path to Catastrophe",
        "content": "Expansion locked Germany into a trajectory of escalating violence and risk. Each conquest deepened its dependence on the next, while ideological radicalism justified atrocities that alienated potential allies. The Soviet gamble was the ultimate overreach, turning temporary advantage into irreversible disaster. Tooze’s analysis reveals that Nazi aggression was not a sign of strength but of weakness: a desperate attempt to escape economic limits through conquest. The strategy guaranteed catastrophe, both for the peoples it victimized and for Germany itself."

    "display_name": "Unit 3",
    "paragraphs": [
      {
        "heading": "The Turn to Forced Labor",
        "content": "As the war dragged on and German manpower was consumed at the front, the regime turned increasingly to forced labor to sustain its economy. Millions of men and women from occupied Europe were deported to work in German factories, farms, and mines. This vast mobilization was presented as a necessity for survival, yet it reflected the underlying weakness of the Nazi economic system. Instead of creating sustainable productivity, Germany relied on coercion to fill its labor shortage. Tooze emphasizes that the forced labor program was not peripheral but central to the functioning of the war economy."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Scale of Exploitation",
        "content": "By 1944, over 7 million foreign workers and prisoners of war were laboring inside the Reich, nearly a quarter of the entire workforce. These men and women came from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and above all the Soviet Union. Conditions were brutal: long hours, poor rations, and exposure to bombing raids without protection. Mortality rates were high, especially for Eastern workers considered racially inferior. The exploitation was not an emergency measure but a planned system of labor extraction, designed to keep factories running while German men were deployed at the front."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Integration of Camps and Industry",
        "content": "The labor system was closely tied to the Nazi camp network. Concentration camps became reservoirs of expendable workers, leased to industrial firms. Companies like IG Farben and Krupp benefited directly from slave labor, integrating exploitation into their production lines. The boundary between ideology and economy blurred: prisoners were dehumanized as 'living tools,' to be used until they died. Tooze highlights that this was not an accidental side effect of the war but a deliberate policy, reflecting both economic desperation and racial ideology."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Economics of Coercion",
        "content": "While forced labor expanded production, it was an inefficient and self-defeating system. Exhausted workers produced less, sabotage was frequent, and the costs of coercion were high. German leaders justified exploitation by pointing to short-term gains, but long-term productivity suffered. In contrast, the Allies relied on voluntary labor mobilization, with workers motivated by higher wages or patriotic duty. The German reliance on coercion reflected the regime’s inability to mobilize resources through persuasion, trust, or institutional stability. Coercion substituted for legitimacy but weakened the economy from within."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Agricultural Exploitation",
        "content": "The exploitation extended to agriculture, where food was stripped from occupied territories to feed the German military and population. In Eastern Europe, this was carried out with genocidal brutality, as the Hunger Plan starved millions of Soviet citizens. In Western Europe, requisitioning created shortages and malnutrition. The aim was to shift the burden of sustaining the Reich onto conquered peoples. Tooze argues that this policy demonstrates how Nazi strategy combined immediate economic needs with ideological contempt for 'inferior' populations. Economic exploitation became indistinguishable from mass atrocity."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Women and Labor",
        "content": "One striking feature of the German economy was the limited mobilization of German women compared to Allied societies. Cultural conservatism and Nazi ideology discouraged large-scale female industrial employment. Instead, the regime relied on imported forced labor to fill the gap. Tooze points out the irony: the refusal to mobilize German women fully into the workforce, while subjecting millions of foreign women to brutal exploitation, reveals the contradictions of the Nazi system. Ideology shaped labor policy in ways that undermined efficiency and increased dependence on coercion."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Resistance and Sabotage",
        "content": "Forced labor was not passive. Workers resisted in countless ways, from slowing down production to acts of sabotage that damaged machinery. These small acts of defiance, multiplied across thousands of workplaces, reduced the effectiveness of the labor program. The Gestapo and SS cracked down harshly, but they could not fully suppress resistance. Tooze stresses that exploitation not only undermined productivity but created resentment and instability within occupied Europe, fueling underground movements that further strained German control. The attempt to coerce productivity backfired politically and economically."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Moral and Strategic Failure",
        "content": "Forced labor propped up the Nazi economy in the short term but undermined it in the long term. Productivity gains were limited, sabotage was widespread, and the brutality of the system alienated millions who might otherwise have remained neutral. The reliance on slave labor highlights the bankruptcy of the regime: it lacked the ability to mobilize its own society effectively and instead resorted to mass coercion. Tooze concludes that exploitation was not only a crime but a strategic blunder. It revealed the contradictions of a regime that claimed to be building a thousand-year empire but could not sustain its economy without destroying its own future."

    "display_name": "Unit 4",
    "paragraphs": [
      {
        "heading": "The Hidden Costs of Rearmament",
        "content": "Germany’s rearmament in the 1930s was financed not through sustainable growth but through credit and borrowing. Mefo bills concealed debt, while the state poured resources into armaments at the expense of civilian consumption. By the outbreak of war, the financial system was already under severe strain. Tooze emphasizes that the Nazi economic miracle was a façade: growth was illusory, built on deferred payments and hidden obligations. The war was, in part, a desperate attempt to resolve this financial crisis by seizing resources abroad."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Financing War Through Plunder",
        "content": "Once conquest began, the German war economy became dependent on systematic plunder. Occupied countries were forced to pay occupation costs, transfer gold reserves, and supply credit to the Reich. France alone transferred billions of francs annually, subsidizing German military expenses. This financial extraction allowed Germany to continue fighting beyond its means. But the strategy was inherently parasitic: it weakened occupied economies, fueled resentment, and could not provide a stable foundation for long-term war. Plunder delayed crisis but could not prevent it."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Role of the Reichsbank",
        "content": "The Reichsbank was central in managing the financial sleight of hand that kept the economy afloat. Under Walther Funk, it facilitated credit expansion, currency manipulation, and the looting of occupied Europe’s reserves. The bank provided the illusion of solvency while hiding the regime’s dependence on conquest. Tooze highlights the moral bankruptcy of the financial system, which laundered stolen gold, including assets seized from Holocaust victims. Finance was not a neutral tool but a weapon, entangled with the crimes of the regime."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Inflationary Pressures",
        "content": "Despite efforts to conceal financial weakness, inflationary pressures mounted. Prices were suppressed by controls, but shortages and black markets proliferated. Workers faced declining real wages, and rationing became increasingly harsh. The regime feared a repeat of the 1923 hyperinflation, which had discredited the Weimar Republic. To avoid open collapse, it imposed rigid controls and shifted the burden onto occupied populations. Tooze argues that this was an economy running on borrowed time, kept alive through coercion and deception rather than stability."
      },
      {
        "heading": "War Bonds and Public Perception",
        "content": "To maintain the appearance of normalcy, the regime issued war bonds and encouraged citizens to invest in the future of the Reich. Propaganda presented this as patriotic duty, disguising the financial desperation behind it. Yet bond purchases could not cover the vast deficits created by the war. The reliance on forced loans from occupied territories and confiscated assets was far more important. The image of a confident, self-sufficient Germany was contradicted by the reality of a state draining resources from conquered peoples to stay solvent."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Dollar Gap and Global Trade",
        "content": "One of Germany’s greatest financial weaknesses was its lack of access to dollars and global trade networks. The Anglo-American alliance controlled global shipping and financial markets, cutting Germany off from vital imports. This meant that even if Germany seized resources in Europe, it struggled to access commodities like oil from abroad. Tooze underscores that Hitler’s war was waged against the backdrop of financial isolation. Without access to world markets, the Reich could not hope to match the global reach of its enemies."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Escalating Burden of War",
        "content": "As the conflict widened, the financial strain intensified. By 1943–44, German finances were collapsing under the weight of prolonged war. The costs of sustaining the Eastern Front, maintaining garrisons across Europe, and producing advanced weapons systems far outstripped revenues. The plunder of occupied territories could not keep pace with expenditure. Tooze shows that the war economy was not sustainable in financial terms: it was consuming its base even as it fought. Collapse was inevitable once military defeats cut off further expansion."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Finance as a Weak Link",
        "content": "Tooze concludes that finance was the hidden weak link of the Nazi war effort. Behind the appearance of strength lay a fragile system dependent on conquest, coercion, and deception. Once expansion stalled, the financial foundations cracked. The war that was supposed to resolve Germany’s economic crisis only deepened it. In the end, the Reich was bankrupted by the very strategy it believed would deliver survival. Finance was not merely a background detail but a decisive factor in Germany’s defeat."

      {
        "heading": "The Weight of Numbers",
        "content": "Tooze makes clear that once the United States entered the war, the economic balance was hopelessly against Germany. The combined output of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union dwarfed anything the Reich could produce. American factories poured out planes, tanks, and trucks in numbers Germany could not imagine matching. Soviet industry, relocated east of the Urals, produced more tanks and artillery than Germany despite devastating losses. Britain’s global empire ensured access to raw materials and shipping routes. The sheer weight of numbers meant that even the most efficient German production could not close the gap."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Mobilization of American Industry",
        "content": "The United States demonstrated what a modern industrial economy could do when fully mobilized for war. Detroit shifted from producing cars to tanks and bombers; shipyards built Liberty ships faster than U-boats could sink them. By 1944, the United States was producing nearly half of all war material used by the Allies. This industrial surge not only equipped American forces but supplied Britain and the Soviet Union through Lend-Lease. Germany had no answer to this flood of production. Tooze emphasizes that the American contribution was not just about scale but about the ability to project power globally."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Soviet Resilience and Production",
        "content": "The Soviet Union absorbed staggering losses in the early years of the war but managed a remarkable recovery. Factories were dismantled and moved eastward beyond the reach of German bombers, where they resumed production on a massive scale. Soviet workers, including women and teenagers, endured harsh conditions but kept output flowing. By 1943, Soviet tank and aircraft production exceeded Germany’s. Tooze highlights that Soviet resilience was both a triumph of planning and a testament to the willingness of the population to endure sacrifices. The Eastern Front consumed German resources while Soviet industry outpaced them."

        "heading": "British Strength and Coordination",
        "content": "Britain, though smaller in population, played a critical role in sustaining the Allied war effort. Its navy maintained control of the seas, ensuring the flow of supplies from America to Europe and the Middle East. British industry, reorganized under central planning, produced aircraft, radar systems, and code-breaking expertise that gave the Allies a crucial edge. Tooze points out that Britain’s role was not merely defensive. It was the linchpin of Allied cooperation, bridging the American and Soviet efforts and coordinating the global struggle against Germany."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Resource Access and Blockade",
        "content": "The Allies had access to the world’s resources—oil from the United States and the Middle East, food from the Americas, and metals from colonies across the globe. Germany, by contrast, was hemmed in by blockade, relying on occupied Europe for supplies that were insufficient to meet its needs. The loss of access to global markets sealed its economic fate. Tooze stresses that Germany’s inability to break the blockade meant it could never match the Allies in critical commodities. The contrast between Allied abundance and German scarcity widened as the war dragged on."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Air Power and Strategic Bombing",
        "content": "Allied economic superiority was amplified by air power. Strategic bombing campaigns disrupted German industry, destroyed transport networks, and forced the diversion of resources to air defense. While controversial in effectiveness, the bombing campaign strained an already overextended economy. Factories dispersed, production slowed, and civilian morale was battered. Tooze argues that air power was a force multiplier: it prevented Germany from concentrating its limited resources effectively while the Allies continued to build strength unimpeded."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Imbalance of Logistics",
        "content": "War is not only about production but about moving goods to the front. The Allies mastered logistics, deploying fleets of trucks, ships, and trains to move men and material across continents. Germany, by contrast, remained dependent on horses for much of its transport. The disparity in mobility was decisive: Allied armies could sustain large offensives while German forces struggled to resupply. Tooze shows that logistics was the hidden dimension of Allied superiority, turning industrial capacity into battlefield victory."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Inevitable Outcome",
        "content": "Once the full weight of Allied economic superiority came to bear, Germany’s defeat was inevitable. Tooze concludes that no amount of tactical brilliance or temporary success could overcome the material imbalance. The Reich’s economy, built on conquest and coercion, could not withstand the combined force of industrial giants arrayed against it. The war became a war of attrition, and in that struggle, Germany had no chance. The collapse of the Reich was written into the economic realities long before the final battles of 1945."

      {
        "heading": "The Turning of the Tide",
        "content": "By 1943, the trajectory of the war had shifted decisively against Germany. Defeats at Stalingrad and El Alamein marked the end of expansion and the beginning of retreat. The Eastern Front consumed vast resources and manpower, while the Western Allies opened new fronts in North Africa and Italy. Tooze argues that Germany was trapped: its economy could no longer sustain the demands of a two-front war, and its hopes for victory through quick conquest had evaporated. From this point onward, the Reich was fighting a defensive war it could not win."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Overextension and Exhaustion",
        "content": "The German war economy was overextended beyond repair. Conquests had provided short-term gains but imposed long-term costs in garrisons, occupation duties, and resistance movements. Supply lines stretched thin across Europe and deep into the Soviet Union. The demands of maintaining multiple fronts drained resources faster than they could be replenished. Tooze highlights that exhaustion was not only military but economic: production could not keep pace with losses, and the system was collapsing under its own weight."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Allied Advance",
        "content": "The Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944 opened a decisive Western front. Germany now faced overwhelming pressure from east and west simultaneously. The rapid advance of Allied forces exposed the hollowness of the Reich’s defenses. Factories were bombed, transport disrupted, and fuel shortages crippled mobility. Tooze underscores that the Allied advance revealed the fragility of the Nazi economy. Once the initiative passed to the Allies, Germany lacked the means to recover. The tide of war became irreversible."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Fuel Crisis",
        "content": "One of the clearest signs of collapse was the fuel crisis. German armies, heavily mechanized, were starved of oil as Allied bombing targeted synthetic fuel plants and the loss of Romanian oil fields cut off supplies. Tanks, aircraft, and trucks stood idle for lack of fuel. The once formidable Wehrmacht was reduced to immobility. Tooze argues that fuel shortages were a decisive factor in Germany’s defeat: without energy, the war machine ground to a halt. This crisis was the direct result of economic weakness and Allied superiority."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The Breakdown of Society",
        "content": "As defeat loomed, German society began to break down. Bombing devastated cities, killing civilians and destroying infrastructure. Rationing left the population hungry and demoralized. The Gestapo and Nazi Party clung to power through repression, but the sense of inevitable defeat spread. Tooze shows that the economic collapse was mirrored by a social collapse. The promise of a thousand-year Reich ended in ruins, with civilians bearing the brunt of the destruction. The war had consumed the society it was meant to elevate."
      },
      {
        "heading": "The End of Financial Illusions",
        "content": "By 1944–45, the financial system that had supported rearmament and war was disintegrating. Currency controls failed, inflation surged on the black market, and occupation plunder could no longer cover deficits. The Reichsbank’s manipulations were exposed as hollow. Tooze notes that the regime was bankrupt both financially and morally. The state that had boasted of strength collapsed under the weight of its own deceptions. The illusion of solvency ended alongside the illusion of invincibility."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Final Resistance",
        "content": "Even as collapse became undeniable, Hitler refused to surrender. The regime demanded total war, mobilizing every last resource and sending boys and old men to the front. Production shifted to emergency weapons like V-2 rockets, but these could not alter the outcome. Tooze emphasizes that this final resistance only deepened the destruction. Germany fought on when defeat was certain, prolonging suffering for both soldiers and civilians. The final months revealed the regime’s indifference to survival if it meant admitting failure."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Defeat and Reckoning",
        "content": "Germany’s defeat in 1945 was not only military but economic. The Reich’s strategy of rearmament on credit, conquest for resources, and exploitation of labor had failed at every level. Allied superiority in production, finance, and logistics ensured victory. Tooze concludes that the Nazi state collapsed because it was built on illusions—of self-sufficiency, of invincibility, of endless conquest. The end was a reckoning with reality: a regime that promised to dominate Europe had instead destroyed itself, leaving behind devastation and proof of the limits of power built on coercion and plunder."
