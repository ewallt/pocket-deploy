<header class="h"><h1>The Dangerous Misunderstanding</h1><p class="intro">*The popular but false story: God “loses patience,” walks away, and disaster follows.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The parable begins with villagers turning on the man who tends their nuclear plant. Mocked and mistreated, he finally storms out. With no one regulating the volatile systems, the plant fails and the town perishes. It is a grim morality tale—and a faithful rendering of how many imagine divine judgment.</p>
<p>In that telling, God’s wrath is temper: a threshold crossed, a protection lifted in pique. He abandons the guilty, and calamity proves His point. The psychology is understandable because it mirrors human rulers, but it projects our methods onto God. The picture flatters our instincts and slanders His character.</p>
<p>What’s wrong is not the sequence but the motive. Withdrawal can occur, but never as retaliation. The true God does not weaponize absence. He is not the engineer of catastrophe; He is the one delaying it. To call His grief-stricken withdrawal “execution” is to replace love with power.</p>
<p>This first version survives because it seems practical. It motivates compliance by fear and makes easy sense of troubling texts. But it cannot stand beside Christ, whose patience under provocation reveals that heaven’s government never turns coercive.</p>
<p>Before we see the real story, we must unlearn this one. Divine wrath is not volatility; it is the pain of rejected love. Any reading that casts God as the quitter who proves a point by leaving has mistaken the villain for the Father.</p>
