<header class="h"><h1>The Quantum Break</h1><p>When light and matter revealed a grainy, unpredictable side to nature.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, physics began to betray its own certainties. Experiments on heat radiation and electricity produced results that defied classical mechanics. The smooth, continuous universe was fracturing into quanta—discrete packets of energy that resisted intuition.</p>
<p>In 1900, Max Planck reluctantly introduced the idea that energy could be emitted only in multiples of a fundamental unit, hν. It was a mathematical trick to fit data, but its success hinted that nature itself might be quantized. Five years later, Einstein went further: light behaves as if made of particles—photons—whose energy depends on frequency, not intensity. Determinism now faced a crisis at the smallest scales.</p>
<p>The photoelectric effect, blackbody radiation, and atomic spectra all pointed toward discontinuity. Atoms absorbed and released energy in jumps, not flows. The tidy clockwork of Newton gave way to a staircase of probabilities.</p>
<p>Even as these ideas triumphed experimentally, Einstein himself hesitated. He sought hidden variables that would restore causality. Yet his own discoveries had opened a door that would never close: measurement now involved chance, not certainty.</p>
<p>The quantum hypothesis did not abolish law—it replaced certainty with statistics. Where Laplace’s demon could once predict everything, now it could only compute likelihoods. The seed of indeterminacy had germinated inside physics itself.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, the quantum revolution had arrived. The world was no longer a predictable machine but a shimmering field of probabilities, its precision exact yet its outcomes fundamentally unpredictable.</p>
