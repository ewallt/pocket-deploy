<header class="h"><h1>The Greeks Desire to See Jesus — Part 1: “Sir, We Would See Jesus”</h1><p class="intro">In the outer court, Gentile seekers ask for sight—and Jesus answers with the cross.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>John tells it with elegant brevity: “There were certain Greeks … who came to Philip … ‘Sir, we would see Jesus.’” The setting matters. They stand where walls usually say “thus far,” in the court allotted to outsiders. Their request is simple and seismic. If the nations may see, then Israel’s hope is ripening toward its global purpose. Philip consults Andrew, then both bring the petition to Jesus, and the story turns from access to announcement: “The hour has come.” Curiosity becomes the doorway to a revelation timed for the world.</p>
<p>Jesus does not schedule a private audience or stage a spectacle. He speaks of a seed. Unless it falls and dies, it remains alone; if it dies, it bears much fruit. The answer feels oblique until we recognize what the Greeks are asking: not a glimpse, but the truth about who He is. The cross is that truth in public. It will be the unveiling that can hold Jew and Gentile within one mercy, the sign clear enough to read from any distance. To “see” Him is to see love spend itself.</p>
<p>The request also dignifies spiritual hunger outside familiar lines. These are not tourists collecting religious experiences; they are worshipers who have walked as far as they are allowed. Jesus’ response honors their desire by preparing a gift no gate can block. When He is lifted up, He will draw all. The court that once enforced separation will become a memory of barriers the gospel outlived, and the temple’s true vocation—“for all nations”—will be fulfilled at another altar, on a hill.</p>
<p>For disciples, Philip and Andrew offer a pattern: when outsiders ask, we bring them to Jesus without becoming bottlenecks. They do not vet motives or guard access; they pass along the hunger they hear. Ministry at the boundary requires ears that do not bristle and hands that do not hoard. The chapter commends that posture as the Spirit’s favorite pathway for widening joy.</p>
<p>Seeing Jesus, then, is not merely visual. It is moral recognition—perceiving the beauty of self-giving love and trusting it enough to follow. The Greeks’ sentence becomes a prayer for every community: “Let them see Him here.” Not our polish, not our pedigree, but the Person who tells the truth and bears the cost. If He is clearly portrayed among us, seekers will not be turned away by our walls or our noise.</p>
<p>At the edge of the court, hope changes tense. “We would see” becomes “we will see,” because the hour will not stall. The seed will fall; the fruit will come; the draw will begin. The nations will not be shushed. And the church, remembering this day, will keep clearing sightlines—so the request that started in Greek can be answered in every tongue.</p>
