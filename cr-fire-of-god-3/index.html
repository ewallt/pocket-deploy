<section class="p">
<p>Isaiah trembled in the temple, undone by the sight of glory. A coal from the altar touched his lips and he did not die; he was healed. The vision clarifies what divine fire intends: not erasure of the sinner, but removal of the thing that makes the sinner unsafe. Purification is surgery, not scorched earth.</p>
<p>Throughout Scripture, the symbols agree. Gold refined in the furnace, chaff burned from wheat, branches pruned to bear fruit. The process hurts because it separates us from what we have confused with ourselves. Love is relentless precisely because it desires our wholeness.</p>
<p>Christ stands at the heart of this work. His eyes are “like flames” not to intimidate, but to see truly. He names our mixed motives without contempt, then invites consent to the flame that frees. Repentance is simply stepping into the light and letting what cannot love Him burn away.</p>
<p>Communities feel this fire corporately. A church that welcomes truth will pass through seasons of candor, confession, and reordering. Hidden rivalries and quiet injustices ignite as they surface. The result is not a smaller church, but a clearer one—lighter by the weight of secrets, brighter with the warmth of grace.</p>
<p>When we fear holiness, we imagine a God eager to strip us of joy. The opposite is true. He is jealous for everything about us that can live forever, and jealous against everything that cannot. His jealousy is the heat of faithful love.</p>
<p>To pray for holiness, then, is to invite the fire that makes us real. We come to the altar not to be destroyed, but to be made dangerous to evil and safe for love.</p>
