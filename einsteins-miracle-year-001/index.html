      <article>
        <p>In 1905, Albert Einstein, then a 26-year-old technical expert at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, published a sequence of papers that reshaped multiple branches of physics. Historians later dubbed this period his <em>annus mirabilis</em>, or “miracle year.” The term reflects the unusual concentration of original results appearing within months of one another in the journal <em>Annalen der Physik</em>. Taken together, the papers addressed light’s particle-like behavior, Brownian motion, the relativity of simultaneity, and the mass–energy relation, establishing themes that would dominate twentieth-century physical theory.</p>

        <p>Einstein’s work emerged from a European scientific scene already debating the nature of matter, ether, and electromagnetic theory. Max Planck’s quantum hypothesis (1900) had introduced discretization of energy, while precise measurements in electrodynamics exposed tensions between Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell’s equations. Experimental puzzles—such as the photoelectric effect and erratic particle motion in fluids—suggested gaps in existing frameworks. Einstein’s 1905 papers did not settle these debates immediately; rather, they offered testable explanations and conceptual reframing that other researchers soon examined and extended.</p>

        <p>The first landmark of 1905 concerned the photoelectric effect. Einstein proposed that light in certain contexts behaves as localized energy quanta, later termed photons. This model accounted for threshold frequencies and the linear relation between electron kinetic energy and light frequency, features not explained by classical waves. Although initially controversial, the idea gained support through subsequent experiments and later developments in quantum theory. The paper’s influence extended beyond one phenomenon: it made discrete energy transfer a central tool for understanding radiation–matter interactions.</p>

        <p>A second paper analyzed Brownian motion—the jittery movement of small particles suspended in liquids. By connecting observable displacement statistics to molecular agitation, Einstein provided a method to estimate Avogadro’s number and, by implication, strong evidence for the atomic theory of matter. Jean Perrin’s experiments in the following years corroborated the predictions. This contribution was methodological as much as theoretical: it showed how probabilistic reasoning and careful measurement could establish microscopic reality from macroscopic data.</p>

        <p>Special relativity formed the year’s most conceptually radical step. Einstein argued that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames and that the speed of light in vacuum is constant, independent of the motion of the source. From these postulates followed time dilation, length contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity without invoking ether. The formulation reconciled Maxwell’s equations with mechanics by revising notions of space and time, guiding later work by Minkowski, Lorentz, and others toward a spacetime interpretation.</p>

        <p>In a brief follow-up note, Einstein derived the relation between mass and energy, commonly written as \(E = mc^2\). He interpreted mass as a measure of energy content, implying that small mass changes correspond to significant energy release due to the factor \(c^2\). While not accompanied by immediate experimental demonstration in 1905, the relation became foundational across nuclear physics and cosmology. It also linked the year’s themes by emphasizing conservation principles within the relativistic framework.</p>

        <p>Reception was gradual but decisive. Planck and other senior physicists engaged critically with the proposals, and empirical tests in the following decade strengthened their standing. The cumulative effect of the 1905 papers was to legitimize quantum ideas, affirm atomic theory through statistical physics, and redefine kinematics. This introductory article outlines the historical and scientific context; subsequent entries will examine each paper’s arguments, mathematics, and experimental legacy in more detail.</p>
