Ellen White and the 1888 Message: “A Most Precious Message”
1. Overview
Ellen G. White’s involvement with the 1888 message is central to its meaning and ongoing significance within Adventism. She strongly supported the core emphasis on Christ’s righteousness and justification by faith, describing it as a “most precious message” sent by God to His people. At the same time, she rebuked attitudes of resistance and prejudice among church leaders and workers that hindered the message’s reception. Her writings connect the 1888 message with the third angel’s message, the loud cry, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, framing it as part of God’s final work of grace, not a peripheral theological episode.
Her testimony is complex: she did not endorse every expression or detail of Jones’s and Waggoner’s teaching, but she repeatedly affirmed that the Lord was speaking through them in their uplift of Christ and His righteousness. She also insisted that the message had not been fully received and that spiritual blindness and self-sufficiency were significant obstacles.

2. Ellen White’s Initial Support at Minneapolis
2.1 Discerning the Lord’s Leading
At the Minneapolis General Conference Session and in its aftermath, Ellen White made clear that she recognized God’s hand in the message preached by Waggoner and Jones:
She testified that the Lord had sent a message through these messengers to bring Christ and His righteousness to the forefront.


She affirmed that this emphasis was heaven’s remedy for spiritual dryness, self-confidence, and a law-centered religiosity that had lost sight of Jesus.


In her public talks and private conversations at the session, she sought to quiet contentious debates and redirect attention to the spiritual purpose of the message.
2.2 Distinguishing Message from Messenger
Ellen White also modeled a careful distinction:
She did not claim that Jones and Waggoner were infallible or that every word they spoke was beyond correction.


She emphasized that it was the core message—Christ uplifted, justification by faith, and the work of the Holy Spirit—that bore heaven’s endorsement.


She urged her hearers to test what was said by Scripture and to avoid personal animosity or partisan loyalty.


This distinction allowed her to rebuke extremes or unbalanced statements when needed, without undermining the essential thrust of the message.

3. “A Most Precious Message”
3.1 Description of the Message
In later reflections, Ellen White famously called the 1888 emphasis “a most precious message”:
She described it as presenting justification through faith in the Surety.


It brought before the people the uplifted Savior, His merits, and His all-sufficient righteousness.


The message called for the reception of Christ’s righteousness, manifested in obedience to all the commandments of God.


Her characterization underscores that the message was not simply a doctrinal refinement but a fresh, heart-reaching presentation of the gospel within Adventism.
3.2 Intended Effects
Ellen White understood this message as designed to:
Lead believers to a deeper repentance and heart conversion.


Correct an overemphasis on human effort and formalism.


Open the way for the Holy Spirit to work more fully in and through the church.


She saw it as God’s initiative to heal spiritual dryness and to prepare a people for the final work and the coming of Christ.

4. Connection to the Third Angel’s Message and the Loud Cry
4.1 Third Angel’s Message in Verity
Ellen White explicitly linked the 1888 message to the third angel’s message:
She identified it as the third angel’s message “in verity,” meaning in its true, essential form.


For her, the third angel’s message was not only about warning against the beast and his image or about Sabbath observance; it was fundamentally about the faith of Jesus and the righteousness of Christ.


The 1888 emphasis restored this gospel core to prominence, making Adventist proclamation more fully Christ-centered.


This framing shows that she understood the message not as an optional enrichment but as central to Adventism’s prophetic calling.
4.2 Beginning of the Loud Cry
She also connected this message with the loud cry and the latter rain:
She wrote that the loud cry of the third angel had already begun in the revelation of the righteousness of Christ.


The light of this message, she said, was the beginning of the glory of the angel of Revelation 18, whose splendor will fill the whole earth.


The implication is that the 1888 message was intended as the front edge of the final outpouring of the Spirit and the worldwide illumination of God’s character.


This connection has profound implications for how Adventists understand the delay in Christ’s coming and the conditions for the latter rain.

5. Resistance and Rejection
5.1 Spiritual Causes of Opposition
Ellen White was frank about the resistance that arose:
She pointed to pride, prejudice, and an unwillingness to yield preconceived opinions as root causes of the opposition.


She warned that some had manifested a spirit similar to that of the Jews who rejected Christ’s message because it did not align with their expectations.


She lamented that personal feelings and institutional loyalties had been allowed to stand in the way of receiving light from heaven.


Her diagnosis suggests that the conflict was as much spiritual and relational as theological.
5.2 Consequences of Resistance
She also described the consequences of this resistance:
Satan, she said, had succeeded in shutting away from God’s people, in great measure, the special power of the Holy Spirit that God longed to impart.


The light that was to lighten the whole earth with its glory had been resisted and kept away from the world.


The fullness of the blessing that God intended to pour out at that time was not realized.


These statements later became crucial in interpretations, such as those by Robert J. Wieland, that see in 1888 a decisive missed opportunity linked with the continuing delay of Christ’s return.

6. Call to Repentance and Continued Reception
6.1 Ongoing Relevance
Ellen White did not treat 1888 as a closed episode:
She repeatedly called for deeper repentance and a fuller reception of the message in the years that followed.


She urged ministers and members alike to study and proclaim Christ’s righteousness more clearly and to seek the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.


She warned that merely acknowledging the message intellectually, without heart appropriation, would not satisfy heaven’s purpose.


Her appeals suggest that the 1888 message is an ongoing summons, not a historical curiosity.
6.2 Avoiding Extremes
At the same time, she counseled against extremes:
She cautioned against using the message as a pretext for doctrinal looseness or moral laxity.


She upheld the importance of obedience, holiness, and adherence to the law of God as the fruit of faith.


She resisted both cold formalism and shallow emotionalism, calling for a balanced experience grounded in Scripture and centered in Christ.


This balance helped frame the 1888 message as an integrated call to both gospel assurance and transformed living.

7. Impact on Adventist Self-Understanding
7.1 A Mirror for the Church
Ellen White’s testimony about 1888 functions as a mirror:
It exposes the danger of doctrinal pride and institutional self-satisfaction.


It reveals how easy it is for a people who possess much truth to lose sight of its center—Christ and His righteousness.


It warns that resistance to fresh light, especially in the area of the gospel, can have far-reaching consequences for the church’s mission.


Her reflections invite each generation to ask whether the core message has truly been received or merely acknowledged.
7.2 A Call to a Deeper Gospel
Her endorsement of the 1888 emphasis continues to call Adventists to:
Preach Christ and His righteousness clearly and centrally.


Integrate the three angels’ messages with a robust gospel proclamation.


Seek the fullness of the Holy Spirit’s work in preparing a people who reflect God’s character and carry His message to the world.


In this way, Ellen White’s role is not simply historical validation of the 1888 message; it is a prophetic voice urging the church to embrace, embody, and share that “most precious message” until the earth is lightened with the glory of God.
