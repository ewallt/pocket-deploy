<header class="h"><h1>What Is a Real Number?</h1><p class="intro">To make limits honest, the number system had to be complete. Two rival constructions delivered it.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Early calculus tacitly assumed the number line had no gaps: every limit worth talking about landed on a number already in the system. But rationals alone are porous; sequences like decimal truncations of √2 get arbitrarily close without ever arriving. Analysts needed a definition of “real number” that sealed the holes and made convergence statements literal, not metaphorical. The goal was simple to state and deep to achieve: if a sequence behaves as if it should converge, the limit must exist as a bona fide number in the same universe.</p>
<p>Dedekind approached the problem set-theoretically. He defined a real as a cut— a partition of the rationals into two nonempty sets A|B with every element of A less than every element of B and A having no greatest element. Each cut represents a position on the line; rationals correspond to cuts where one side has a greatest element, irrationals to cuts where neither side does. With cuts, “gaps” are filled by construction, and order properties are built in. The supremum of a bounded nonempty set exists because you can take the union of left sets; the least upper bound is no longer wishful thinking but guaranteed.</p>
<p>Cauchy’s spirit lives in the alternative construction via Cauchy sequences. A real is an equivalence class of rational sequences that become arbitrarily close to each other; two sequences are equivalent if their difference tends to zero. Arithmetic is defined termwise, and limits are limits of representatives. This makes “completeness” explicit: every Cauchy sequence converges by design. Analysts gain a handle aligned with computation, since many limits arise from improving rational approximations. Both constructions yield isomorphic ordered fields; choosing one is taste and convenience, not mathematics changing its mind.</p>
<p>With the reals in place, three cornerstones crystallize. The least upper bound (supremum) property ensures bounded sets have suprema; the Archimedean property rules out infinitely large or small “numbers” hiding in the reals; and order completeness ties sequences and sets together. These are not decorative axioms but engines: they power proofs of the Intermediate Value Theorem, existence of exp and log via limits, and convergence criteria for series. Whenever a proof quietly uses “take the supremum” or “choose a convergent subsequence,” it is spending completeness capital earned by the construction of ℝ.</p>
<p>Completeness immediately informs the language of subsequences and accumulation. A bounded monotone sequence converges because its set of terms has a supremum; the proof is a direct use of least upper bound. When monotonicity disappears, we don’t surrender; we look for regularity inside irregularity by passing to subsequences. The very expectation that a bounded sequence must have convergent behavior somewhere is a completeness-flavored instinct. Bolzano–Weierstrass makes that instinct precise, translating “there ought to be order” into an existence theorem with durable consequences.</p>
<p>The moral is that numbers and limits were rebuilt together. You can’t discuss convergence rigorously without knowing what counts as a limit, and you can’t define reals convincingly without an account of limiting processes. Dedekind and Cauchy solved the two sides of one coin. Their work cleared the path for compactness and subsequence principles, culminating in statements like Bolzano–Weierstrass that domesticate infinity on the newly solid number line.</p>
