<section class="p">
<p>Biblical judgment is often imagined as a secret verdict. Scripture portrays something more public and persuasive. God “comes” with books open and motives displayed. He explains Himself before He executes sentence, inviting understanding rather than demanding submission. The goal is not to win a case but to win hearts to the truth.</p>
<p>Vindication does not mean God gains new dignity; it means creatures gain new clarity. Misread providences are reinterpreted. Delays are revealed as mercy. The patience that once looked like indifference is seen as the fierce commitment of love refusing to abandon the slow learner.</p>
<p>The cross anchors the final scene. The Judge bears scars that make hypocrisy impossible. Any decision rendered by wounded hands is already marked by solidarity with the judged. Justice is severe only toward what destroys; it is relentlessly protective of persons.</p>
<p>When the light is fully on, two things happen. Lies lose their persuasive power, and character stands self-evident. Those who love the truth rejoice to live with such a King. Those who cling to falsehood recognize that heaven would be torment to their cherished ways—and they say so.</p>
<p>The universe rests at last because trust is restored. Governance by love has been tested under every stress and found trustworthy. The war ends not with conquest but with consent—the Name hallowed, the accuser silenced, the family reconciled.</p>
<p>To anticipate that day is to practice its logic now: open dealings, honest confession, merciful judgment, cruciform authority. In such habits, God’s vindication is rehearsed before the world.</p>
