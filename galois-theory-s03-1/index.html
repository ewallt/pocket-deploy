<h1>Galois Theory: Perspectives and Legacy</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 1 · Applications to Classical Problems</p>
<article>
<p>Galois theory's power extends beyond resolving the solvability of polynomial equations; it provides a systematic framework for addressing classical problems that resisted solutions for centuries. By translating geometric and algebraic questions into group-theoretic language, Galois theory makes formerly intractable problems accessible to rigorous analysis. The impossibility of certain geometric constructions, the characterization of which regular polygons can be constructed, and insights into the structure of algebraic number fields all follow from Galois-theoretic principles. These applications demonstrate that Galois theory is not merely abstract formalism but a versatile tool with deep implications for diverse mathematical domains. We explore several key applications, showing how the Fundamental Theorem and group structure yield concrete results.</p>
<p>The classical problem of constructing regular n-gons with compass and straightedge exemplifies Galois theory's reach into geometry. As discussed earlier, a regular n-gon is constructible if and only if φ(n) is a power of 2, which occurs when n = 2^k · p₁ · ··· · pᵣ with distinct Fermat primes pᵢ. This result follows from analyzing the Galois group Gal(ℚ(ζₙ)/ℚ) ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)* and determining when this group has order a power of 2 (ensuring a tower of quadratic extensions, each corresponding to a compass-and-straightedge step). Gauss proved constructibility of the 17-gon in 1796, a landmark result that demonstrated the utility of algebra for geometry. Subsequent work showed constructibility of 257- and 65537-gons, though actual constructions are prohibitively complex. The impossibility of the heptagon (7 sides) follows from φ(7) = 6, which is not a power of 2. Galois theory thus provides a complete classification, turning an ancient geometric puzzle into a solved problem of group theory.</p>
<p>Fermat's Last Theorem, while ultimately proven by Wiles (1994) using tools far beyond classical Galois theory, was historically approached via Galois-theoretic methods. Kummer's work in the 19th century introduced ideal class groups and studied cyclotomic fields ℚ(ζₚ) for prime p. He proved Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes—primes p that do not divide the class number of ℚ(ζₚ)—by exploiting the Galois structure of cyclotomic extensions. The Galois group (ℤ/pℤ)* acts on ideals in the ring of integers of ℚ(ζₚ), and this action encodes arithmetic properties crucial to factorization. Although Kummer's approach did not settle the theorem completely, it revealed deep connections between Galois theory, algebraic number theory, and Diophantine equations, setting the stage for later developments such as class field theory and the Langlands program.</p>
<p>Solving polynomial equations by radicals remains a central application. Galois theory precisely characterizes which polynomials admit radical solutions: those whose Galois groups are solvable. For quadratics, cubics, and quartics, the Galois groups are subgroups of S₂, S₃, and S₄, all of which are solvable, hence general formulas exist (quadratic formula, Cardano's formula, Ferrari's method). For quintics, the generic polynomial has Galois group S₅, which is not solvable, so no general formula exists. However, specific quintics such as x⁵ − 2 have solvable Galois groups (e.g., the Frobenius group F₂₀), and explicit radical expressions can be found. Galois theory thus separates the solvable from the insolvable, transforming the question "Can this polynomial be solved?" into the computable problem "Is this Galois group solvable?" Software packages implement these tests, making Galois theory an applied tool in symbolic computation.</p>
<p>Ruler-and-compass constructions more broadly—constructing lengths, angles, and points—reduce to questions about field extensions and their degrees. A real number α is constructible if and only if [ℚ(α):ℚ] is a power of 2. This criterion immediately resolves many classical problems: trisecting a 60° angle is impossible (requires solving a degree-3 polynomial not reducible to quadratics), doubling the cube is impossible (requires ∛2, a degree-3 extension), and squaring the circle is impossible (requires √π, a transcendental number). Galois theory's algebraic reformulation replaces intuitive but vague notions of "constructibility" with precise field-theoretic conditions, enabling definitive proofs. These results were inaccessible to the ancients not due to lack of effort but because the necessary algebraic framework—fields, extensions, degrees—did not yet exist. Galois theory supplied that framework, resolving millennia-old questions decisively.</p>
<p>Algebraic number theory benefits immensely from Galois theory. The study of algebraic number fields (finite extensions of ℚ) and their rings of integers employs Galois groups to understand prime factorization, class numbers, and units. For instance, in a Galois extension K/ℚ, primes in ℤ factor into primes in the ring of integers 𝒪_K, and the factorization pattern is governed by the decomposition and inertia groups, subgroups of Gal(K/ℚ). If a prime p splits completely in K, it factors into [K:ℚ] distinct primes; if it remains inert, it stays prime in 𝒪_K. The Chebotarev Density Theorem, a deep result in analytic number theory, describes the density of primes with given splitting behavior in terms of conjugacy classes in the Galois group, unifying Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions under a Galois-theoretic umbrella. These applications illustrate that Galois groups encode not just solvability but also intricate arithmetic information.</p>
<p>Class field theory extends Galois theory to characterize all abelian extensions of a number field, describing them in terms of generalized ideal class groups and idele class groups. The Kronecker-Weber theorem, a cornerstone of class field theory, states that every finite abelian extension of ℚ is contained in a cyclotomic field ℚ(ζₙ). This remarkable result shows that roots of unity generate all abelian Galois groups over ℚ, a striking unification. More generally, class field theory provides a reciprocity law relating Galois groups to arithmetic data, generalizing quadratic reciprocity and connecting field extensions to L-functions and zeta functions. These developments, rooted in Galois's original ideas, represent some of the deepest achievements in 20th-century number theory. Galois theory thus serves not merely as a tool for specific problems but as a conceptual foundation for entire branches of mathematics, demonstrating its lasting and profound impact.</p>
