<h1>Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 5 · Biblical Language of Divine Change: Scripture's Portrayal of God</p>
<article>
<p>A significant portion of the case for Open Theism rests on a straightforward reading of certain biblical texts. Proponents argue that the scriptures frequently portray God in relational and responsive terms, engaging with humanity in a way that suggests the future is not exhaustively fixed. These texts often describe God as changing His mind, expressing regret, testing people to see what they will do, and speaking about the future in terms of possibilities rather than certainties.</p>
<p>One of the most cited examples is God's "regret" over creating humanity in Genesis 6:6: "the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart." Open Theists take this language at face value, suggesting it reflects God's genuine sorrow over an outcome that was a possible, but not a necessary, result of creating free beings. Similarly, in Exodus 32:14, after Moses intercedes for Israel, the text states that "the LORD changed his mind about the disaster that he had planned to bring on his people." This appears to be a clear instance of divine plans being altered in response to human prayer and action.</p>
<p>Another category of texts involves God testing individuals. For example, in Genesis 22:12, after Abraham demonstrates his willingness to sacrifice Isaac, the angel of the Lord says, "for now I know that you fear God." Open Theists suggest this language implies that God gained knowledge through Abraham's action; the test was a genuine inquiry, not a demonstration of a pre-known fact. These passages depict a God who learns and responds based on the choices of His people.</p>
<p>Classical theists typically interpret such passages as anthropomorphisms—attributing human-like characteristics to God for our benefit, without reflecting His true, unchanging nature. They argue that an immutable God cannot literally change His mind or acquire new knowledge. However, Open Theists counter that while the Bible certainly uses metaphorical language, the sheer volume and consistency of these relational portrayals should be taken seriously as revealing something true about God's nature. Dismissing all such passages as purely metaphorical, they argue, risks imposing a philosophical definition of God (e.g., from Greek philosophy) onto the biblical text that may not fit the Hebrew worldview.</p>
<p>In the Open view, these scriptures are not problematic accommodations but are central to understanding God's character. They reveal a God who is deeply relational, who values human partnership, and who has chosen to create a world where our choices have real, tangible effects on the course of history and on God's own experience. The biblical portrait is not of a distant, impassive monarch, but of a dynamic, responsive, and intimately involved Creator.</p>
