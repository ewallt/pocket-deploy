<header class="h"><h1>The Temple Cleansed Again — Part 2: Mercy in the Court</h1><p class="intro">Cleansing makes room for compassion: once the noise is gone, the needy can finally be heard—and healed.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The most striking line after the purge is not a threat but a welcome: “The blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.” The space cleared by judgment becomes a clinic of grace. What profiteering had crowded out—access for the broken—Jesus restores. The court of the Gentiles, long treated as a marketplace buffer, becomes a mercy room where pain is not priced and presence is not rationed.</p>
<p>Notice the sequence: disruption, then restoration. Love sometimes overturns tables before it can set them. We often want peace without change, quiet without justice. Jesus refuses that bargain. His anger is precise—aimed at barriers, not at seekers. As the animals scatter and the coins roll away, those who had no chance of reaching God through the old arrangement now walk right in.</p>
<p>Children appear next, their voices rising with “Hosanna to the Son of David.” The priests object to the volume and the vocabulary, but Jesus owns both. Out of the mouths of the small comes the temple’s truest liturgy: praise uncoached, unbought, and unafraid. The new order is already audible—mercy at the center, joy at the edges, and leadership learning to receive what it cannot script.</p>
<p>For the powerful, this is threatening; for the powerless, it is oxygen. Systems that protect revenue streams feel destabilized when compassion takes the main stage. Yet this is precisely the correction the chapter urges. A holy place must be safe for the sick, the poor, the foreign, and the young—or it is not holy in the way the Holy One is.</p>
<p>Applied locally, “mercy in the court” reads like a checklist. Are our thresholds low enough for outsiders to cross without embarrassment? Do our budgets and calendars leave margin for people who cannot reciprocate? Do our prayers make space for lament, or only for success? The Son’s cleansing still aims at these bottlenecks, longing to replace them with pathways.</p>
<p>In the end, the court becomes a preview of the church’s vocation. Gathered around Jesus, former consumers become intercessors, former obstacles become ushers, and former customers become family. The world does not need our noise; it needs our nearness. He cleanses so that we can come close.</p>
