<h1>Real Analysis: Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · Limits and Continuity</p>
<article>
<p>Continuity formalizes the intuitive notion that small changes in input produce small changes in output. A function f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous at a point c if lim_{x→c} f(x) = f(c), meaning that the limit exists and equals the function value. This definition decomposes into two requirements: the limit must exist, and it must match f(c). If f is continuous at every point in its domain, it is called a continuous function. Continuity underpins calculus, topology, and differential equations, providing the framework for defining derivatives, integrals, and solution existence theorems.</p>
<p>The epsilon-delta definition makes continuity precise. A function f is continuous at c if for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that |f(x) − f(c)| < ε whenever |x − c| < δ. This formulation quantifies the idea that outputs remain close to f(c) when inputs stay near c. The choice of δ typically depends on both ε and c; functions for which δ can be chosen independent of c satisfy the stronger condition of uniform continuity. The epsilon-delta criterion extends naturally to metric spaces, making it central to modern analysis.</p>
<p>Sequential continuity offers an equivalent characterization: f is continuous at c if and only if for every sequence (xₙ) converging to c, the sequence (f(xₙ)) converges to f(c). This criterion often simplifies proofs, allowing sequence arguments to replace epsilon-delta manipulations. The equivalence holds in metric spaces and relies on completeness and first-countability. Sequential continuity reveals connections between topological and analytical properties, bridging discrete and continuous perspectives. For instance, proving a function is not continuous at a point often involves constructing a sequence where f(xₙ) fails to converge to f(c).</p>
<p>Algebraic operations preserve continuity. If f and g are continuous at c, then f + g, f − g, and fg are continuous at c. If g(c) ≠ 0, then f/g is continuous at c. The composition of continuous functions is continuous: if f is continuous at c and g is continuous at f(c), then g ∘ f is continuous at c. These properties allow construction of complex continuous functions from simple building blocks. Polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, forming a rich library for analysis and applications.</p>
<p>Discontinuities arise when the limit fails to exist or differs from f(c). A removable discontinuity occurs when lim_{x→c} f(x) exists but does not equal f(c); redefining f at c removes the discontinuity. A jump discontinuity appears when left and right limits exist but differ, as in the Heaviside step function. An essential discontinuity occurs when limits do not exist, such as sin(1/x) at 0. Classifying discontinuities clarifies regularity and informs techniques for integration, approximation, and series representation.</p>
<p>One-sided limits refine the analysis near boundary points or discontinuities. The right-hand limit lim_{x→c⁺} f(x) considers only x > c approaching c, while the left-hand limit lim_{x→c⁻} f(x) considers x < c. A function is continuous at c if and only if both one-sided limits exist and equal f(c). One-sided continuity is essential for piecewise functions and for defining derivatives: the derivative at c is the limit of difference quotients, which may exhibit different behavior from left and right. Monotone functions have at most jump discontinuities, illustrating how function properties constrain discontinuity types.</p>
<p>Limits at infinity describe asymptotic behavior. We write lim_{x→∞} f(x) = L if for every ε > 0, there exists M such that |f(x) − L| < ε for all x > M. Horizontal asymptotes correspond to finite limits at infinity, while vertical asymptotes arise when f(x) → ±∞ as x approaches a finite value. Limits at infinity are crucial for understanding convergence of integrals, series, and solutions to differential equations. They also characterize boundedness and growth rates, informing approximations and numerical methods.</p>
<p>The completeness of ℝ ensures that continuous functions on closed bounded intervals behave particularly well, as subsequent articles will explore. Continuity transforms local information into global results, enabling theorems like the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Extreme Value Theorem. Understanding limits and continuity equips the analyst to rigorously study change, approximation, and optimization across mathematics and applied sciences.</p>
