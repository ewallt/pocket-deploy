<h1>Peace for the Universe</h1>
<p class="intro">Peace was not secured by overpowering rebellion but by revealing truth so completely that rebellion makes no sense anymore.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
<p>The victory of God’s case is the end of suspicion. When the evidence of His character stands beyond distortion, trust becomes the natural atmosphere of creation. The angels who once watched in doubt now see clearly that love is the law of life. No one obeys because of fear; all serve because they understand.</p>
<p>True peace rests on persuasion, not restraint. Power can hold rebels in check, but only truth can make rebellion unthinkable. The universe is secure not by fences but by friendship. Freedom has been shown to be safe wherever God is trusted.</p>
<p>On our world, the same verdict must take root in human hearts. Each believer becomes a living exhibit of the case’s outcome—showing by calm confidence that God can be relied upon even when circumstances appear contrary. This is not blind faith but informed trust grounded in evidence already given.</p>
<p>The final judgment simply acknowledges what has been demonstrated: that God’s way is righteous and His creatures free to agree. There are no forced confessions, only joyful recognition that truth has won. The moral universe closes its argument with unanimous consent.</p>
<p>When trust is complete, harmony returns. Love’s authority requires no enforcement. The family of creation is whole again because its members share one understanding of its Lord: that He is good, and there is no darkness in Him.</p>
<p>This is how the war that began with accusation ends—with the peace of minds that have seen the truth for themselves and rest secure forever.</p>
