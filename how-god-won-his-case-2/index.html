  <h1>Truth, Not Power</h1>
  <p class="intro">Lasting peace cannot be engineered by intimidation. It must be built by truth that commands trust.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
  <p>The strongest answer to slander is not a louder voice, but a better record. God’s method has been to let deeds explain doctrine—demonstrations across centuries that reveal consistent goodness. This is costly and slow, and yet it is the only path that respects the dignity of free beings who must be persuaded, not programmed.</p>
  <p>History shows that claims alone are cheap. Falsehood can wear piety, and zeal can mimic love. What unmasks pretense is patient integrity under trial: kindness that does not sour, justice that does not turn cruel, mercy that does not excuse harm. Such constancy is persuasive in a way threats can never be.</p>
  <p>Every act of coercion would have fed the suspicion that government rests on fear. Therefore, God allowed the process to run in the open—successes and failures recorded, questions entertained, objections answered. By refusing shortcuts, He secured a verdict that stands up to investigation rather than collapsing under cross-examination.</p>
  <p>This approach protects freedom at every step. Doubt itself is granted room, not because doubt is virtuous, but because love requires choice. When trust finally returns, it does so with understanding; it is sturdy because it is informed.</p>
  <p>Truth wins differently from power. Power subdues for a moment; truth convinces for good. The government founded on truth does not need to frighten its citizens into loyalty, because they have seen enough to be at peace with how the universe is run.</p>
  <p>Thus the case advances without spectacle. Evidence gathers, testimony accumulates, and a different kind of victory comes into view—the triumph of reality over rumor, of light over suspicion.</p>
