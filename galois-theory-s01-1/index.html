<h1>Galois Theory: Origins and Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 1 · Évariste Galois and the Birth of Modern Algebra</p>
<article>
<p>Évariste Galois was born on October 25, 1811, near Paris, during a period of intense political and intellectual upheaval in France. By the age of fifteen, he had already encountered the works of Legendre and Lagrange, displaying a mathematical precocity that far outpaced his formal education. His teachers at Louis-le-Grand struggled to appreciate his unconventional methods and rapid leaps of intuition. Galois submitted original research to the French Academy of Sciences twice before the age of twenty, but both manuscripts were lost or rejected—Cauchy reportedly misplaced the first, and Fourier died before reviewing the second. These frustrations, compounded by personal tragedy and political activism, defined the turbulent life of a young revolutionary who would reshape mathematics.</p>
<p>Galois's most profound insight came in addressing a centuries-old problem: determining when a polynomial equation can be solved by radicals—that is, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and root extraction. While quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations had been solved by such formulas since the Renaissance, the general quintic remained elusive. In 1824, Niels Henrik Abel proved that no general formula exists for quintic equations, but he did not characterize precisely which quintics are solvable. Galois went further, developing a criterion based on the symmetries of the equation's roots. This criterion, expressed in the language of what we now call group theory, revealed that solvability depends on a specific algebraic structure rather than computational tricks.</p>
<p>The night before his fatal duel on May 30, 1832, Galois frantically wrote a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier, summarizing his discoveries and urging that they be judged by Jacobi or Gauss. The duel, fought over a romantic dispute entangled with political tensions, left Galois mortally wounded; he died the following day at the age of twenty. His manuscripts languished in obscurity for more than a decade until Joseph Liouville recognized their brilliance and published them in 1846. Galois's work introduced the concept of a group—initially as permutations of roots—and laid the foundation for abstract algebra. His ideas were so ahead of their time that even many professional mathematicians struggled to understand them for years after publication.</p>
<p>Galois's central contribution was the realization that the solvability of a polynomial is determined by properties of the group of permutations that preserve algebraic relations among its roots. If this group (now called the Galois group) has a particular structural property—being solvable in the group-theoretic sense—then the polynomial itself is solvable by radicals. This connection between algebraic equations and symmetry groups transformed mathematics from a collection of computational techniques into a discipline grounded in abstract structures and their properties. Galois did not merely solve a problem; he invented a new language for mathematics, one that revealed hidden unities across seemingly disparate areas.</p>
<p>The concept of a group crystallized through Galois's work, though he did not present it in the axiomatic form familiar today. A group consists of a set equipped with an associative operation, an identity element, and inverses for each element. Galois focused on permutation groups—bijections of a set to itself, composed via function composition. The symmetries of polynomial roots naturally form such groups. For instance, the roots of x² − 2 = 0 are ±√2, and swapping them corresponds to the two-element group ℤ₂. More complex polynomials have richer symmetry groups. Galois's insight was that these groups encode solvability: a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group, meaning it can be built from abelian groups via a sequence of normal subgroups.</p>
<p>Galois's ideas remained largely unappreciated during his lifetime, partly because he expressed them tersely and with little pedagogical concession. His writing assumed familiarity with advanced concepts and made logical leaps that contemporaries found difficult to follow. Moreover, his political radicalism—he was a fervent republican imprisoned twice for anti-monarchist activities—alienated him from the conservative mathematical establishment. Only after Liouville's publication and subsequent expositions by mathematicians like Camille Jordan and Émile Picard did Galois theory gain recognition. Jordan's 1870 treatise systematized Galois's results, clarifying the connection between polynomial solvability and group structure, and demonstrating applications to classical geometric problems such as angle trisection and doubling the cube.</p>
<p>Today, Galois is celebrated not only for specific theorems but for inaugurating a paradigm shift in mathematical thought. Before Galois, algebra was primarily concerned with manipulating equations and finding explicit solutions. After Galois, mathematicians increasingly focused on abstract structures—groups, rings, fields—and the relationships between them. This structural approach pervades modern mathematics: topology studies spaces via their invariants, category theory unifies disparate structures through morphisms, and algebraic geometry interprets geometric problems via commutative algebra. Galois theory itself has expanded far beyond polynomial equations, influencing number theory (class field theory), topology (covering spaces and fundamental groups), and even quantum mechanics (symmetry groups of physical systems). The tragic brevity of Galois's life contrasts sharply with the enduring depth and breadth of his legacy.</p>
