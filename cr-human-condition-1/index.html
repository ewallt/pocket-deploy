<header class="h"><h1>The Nature of Sin</h1><p class="intro">*At its core, sin is relational rupture, not mere rule-breaking.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>In Scripture, sin first appears as disbelief in God’s goodness. The act that follows simply reveals the distrust already at work. When love is questioned, self-interest rushes in to fill the vacuum. What was once partnership becomes competition; what was joy becomes self-protection.</p>
<p>The prophets describe sin not as a list of forbidden deeds but as a sickness of the heart—alienation from the Source of life. Isaiah pictures wounds that will not heal because they are infected with falsehood. To rebel against love is to wound oneself; the law only diagnoses what distrust has already done.</p>
<p>Jesus deepens the definition. He names anger as murder in seed form and lust as adultery of the imagination. Sin begins where others become objects to be managed rather than persons to be loved. It is the inward turning of the will that bends even good gifts into tools of self-exaltation.</p>
<p>This is why forgiveness must reach deeper than behavior. God does not merely cancel penalties; He restores trust. The gospel is not leniency but cure. Only the revelation of His character can undo the lie that made sin plausible.</p>
<p>To see sin clearly is to see need clearly. The Spirit convicts not to shame but to awaken. The wound is serious, but the Physician is near—and healing begins with honesty about the disease.</p>
