<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis and Historical Development</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 5 · Open Theism vs. Classical Theism</p>
<article>
<p>Classical theism affirms that God exists outside of time in an eternal present where past, present, and future are simultaneously accessible. From this eternal vantage point, God knows all temporal events at once without learning or changing. Open Theism rejects divine timelessness, arguing that the biblical God experiences temporal succession—responding to events as they unfold, remembering the past, acting in the present, and facing a partially open future. Timelessness originated in Platonic philosophy, where perfection required unchanging permanence. Open theists argue this Greek conception distorts biblical revelation, which portrays God as intimately engaged with time and history. Classical theists defend timelessness as necessary for divine perfection, since temporal succession implies dependence on external factors. The debate reflects fundamentally different starting points—Greek philosophical theology versus Hebrew narrative theology.</p>

<p>Divine impassibility means God cannot suffer or be affected by external events. Classical theism embraced impassibility to secure God's self-sufficiency and perfection. If creatures can cause God to experience unwanted emotions or suffering, God seems dependent on creation, lacking full blessedness. Open theists reject impassibility, seeing it as incompatible with biblical portrayals of God's passionate love, grief over sin, and joy in obedience. The God who loves can be hurt by rejection; the God who cares experiences genuine sorrow over evil. Far from diminishing God's perfection, this emotional responsiveness reflects the fullness of personal perfection. Being unmoved by the suffering of loved ones would represent a defect, not a perfection. Classical theists worry that affirming divine passibility makes God vulnerable and dependent. The question is whether perfect love requires impassibility or whether genuine love entails vulnerability.</p>

<p>Divine simplicity, the doctrine that God has no parts or compositional complexity, serves in classical theism to secure God's aseity and necessity. A composite being depends on its parts and requires explanation for why the parts are combined. God, being self-existent and ultimate, must be absolutely simple. Open theists question whether simplicity is biblically warranted or philosophically necessary. Scripture presents God as having distinct attributes—power, knowledge, love, justice—even if ultimately unified in the divine essence. Philosophical problems arise from strict simplicity: if God is identical to each divine attribute, and each attribute is identical to every other, then God's knowledge is identical to God's power, which seems incoherent. Classical theists defend simplicity through careful metaphysical distinctions about identity and predication. Open theists find these moves philosophically suspect and biblically unmotivated, preferring to see God as having distinct but harmonious attributes.</p>

<p>The classical view of providence involves God ordaining all events down to the smallest detail through eternal comprehensive decree. Nothing happens by chance or contingency; all is part of God's meticulous plan. Open Theism advocates "open providence"—God sets boundaries, establishes goals, works powerfully within constraints of creaturely freedom, and guarantees ultimate outcomes while leaving many interim details genuinely undetermined. God governs the world through responsive, wise engagement rather than exhaustive control. Critics charge this makes providence precarious and uncertain, unable to guarantee God's purposes. Advocates respond that God's unsurpassable wisdom and power suffice to accomplish intended ends through skillful navigation of partially undetermined processes. The question is whether sovereignty requires meticulous control or whether wise management of genuinely free agents represents greater power.</p>

<p>Prayer functions differently in each framework. Classical theism affirms that God eternally decrees both prayers and their answers together. When believers pray, they enact divinely ordained means to divinely ordained ends. The prayer genuinely causes the outcome, but only because God eternally planned both the prayer and the result. Open Theism sees prayer as genuinely influencing God's decisions about a partially open future. God knows what will happen if the prayer is offered versus not offered, and decides accordingly. When believers pray, they affect actual divine deliberation about future actions. Critics say this makes God dependent on creatures; advocates reply it makes prayer meaningful rather than theatrical. The practical difference appears minimal—both views encourage earnest prayer—but the metaphysical implications differ significantly. The question is whether prayer changes God's mind or simply fulfills God's eternal plan.</p>

<p>Theodicy—explaining evil while maintaining God's goodness and power—takes different forms. Classical theism typically affirms that God permits evil for good reasons, incorporating even horrendous evils into an overall good plan. Every instance of evil serves some greater purpose, even if humans cannot discern it. Open Theism denies that God specifically allows each evil for some outweighing reason. Much evil results from creaturely free choices that God does not want and works against. God grieves over evil, fights to overcome it, and will ultimately defeat it, but does not orchestrate it for hidden purposes. Some evils serve no greater good and represent pure loss that God redeems but did not intend. Critics see this as limiting divine sovereignty; advocates see it as defending God's character against charges of culpability for evil. The stakes involve both God's reputation and pastoral care for suffering people.</p>

<p>The fundamental disagreement concerns authority and method. Classical theism claims vindication through church tradition, the consensus of great theologians, and systematic coherence with core Christian doctrines. Open Theism appeals to biblical narrative, straightforward exegesis unfiltered through philosophical assumptions, and existential fidelity to lived Christian experience. Classical theists charge open theists with abandoning catholic tradition and embracing a God who is too small. Open theists charge classical theists with privileging Greek philosophy over biblical revelation and defending a God who is too static. Both sides claim to honor Scripture, worship the true God, and preserve authentic Christianity. The debate will likely continue, turning on questions of theological method, hermeneutical approach, and what sources should have priority when Scripture, tradition, philosophy, and experience offer different insights. Resolution requires not merely settling exegetical disputes but adjudicating more basic questions about theological authority and the nature of faithfulness to revelation.</p>
