<section class="p">
<p>Scripture ends where it began: a garden, now a city-garden, where God dwells with His people. The curse is lifted; tears are dried. What was promised in fragments arrives in fullness—life unthreatened by decay and community unfractured by suspicion.</p>
<p>The new creation is not an escape from earth but earth made whole. Culture flourishes without domination; work becomes creativity without exploitation. Memory remains, but pain does not rule it. We recognize one another not by our wounds but by the wisdom love has forged in us.</p>
<p>The universe opens because fear is closed. Travel is not flight from danger but the joy of discovery. Other worlds become other classrooms in the endless study of God’s ways. Curiosity finally has a home where nothing sacred must be hidden and nothing good can be lost.</p>
<p>Worship ceases to be an event and becomes an environment. Justice is the air; mercy, the climate. Authority is trusted because its scars are visible. Kingship looks like service, and glory looks like the radiance of faces that have seen God.</p>
<p>This is not wishful thinking; it is the logic of the cross expanding to fill creation. If love is the law of life, then a healed world is simply life obeying its law at last.</p>
