<h1>Why God Went to Court</h1>
<p class="intro">The controversy in heaven was not about power but about truth—whether God could be trusted.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
<p>When Scripture pictures God “going into court,” it portrays a universe where His character has been publicly challenged. The accusations are not about ability but integrity: is God worthy of trust, or does He rule by threat? Every being is a potential juror, observing how He responds to charges that began with the rebellion of a once-brilliant angel.</p>
<p>If God had silenced opposition by force, fear might have triumphed but not faith. Love cannot be commanded. Trust cannot be demanded. A universe ruled by coercion would be orderly but not free, obedient but not loyal. God’s purpose is harmony built on voluntary confidence, not submission through fear.</p>
<p>The war that began in heaven reached our world when distrust entered the human heart. Through deceit, the adversary portrayed God as severe and self-centered, claiming that His warnings were manipulative and His laws arbitrary. Humanity’s fall was not merely moral failure; it was a collapse of trust in the One who gave life.</p>
<p>Restoring that trust became God’s greatest work. The courtroom metaphor underscores His openness—He does not hide behind power or mystery but submits His ways to scrutiny. The evidence is not for His sake but for ours, and for the vast family of creation watching to see whether love or accusation speaks the truth.</p>
<p>Thus, God went to court not to win by decree but to reveal by demonstration. His defense is the story of His actions: transparent, patient, and faithful in the face of rebellion. He invites all beings to decide, not under threat, but by the weight of evidence.</p>
