      <h1>Real Analysis: Foundations</h1>
      <p class="lead">Part 1 · The Real Numbers and Completeness</p>

      <article>
        <p>Real analysis begins with the real number system, a complete ordered field whose properties underpin calculus, topology, and measure theory. The real numbers extend the rationals by filling gaps—such as √2 or the limit of Cauchy sequences—that arise from taking limits or solving algebraic equations. This completeness distinguishes the reals from the rationals and ensures that analytical arguments proceed without encountering unfilled holes in the number line. The axiomatic approach defines the reals through field axioms, order axioms, and the completeness axiom, providing a rigorous foundation for convergence and continuity.</p>

        <p>The field axioms state that addition and multiplication on ℝ are associative, commutative, and distributive, with identities 0 and 1 and inverses for every nonzero element. The order axioms introduce a relation < compatible with addition and multiplication, partitioning ℝ into positive, negative, and zero. Together, these axioms define an ordered field. However, the rationals ℚ also satisfy these axioms, so completeness is the property that distinguishes ℝ. Completeness can be formulated in several equivalent ways: the least upper bound property, Cauchy completeness, nested interval property, or Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.</p>

        <p>The least upper bound property, often taken as the defining axiom, asserts that every nonempty subset of ℝ bounded above has a supremum in ℝ. A supremum is the smallest upper bound, and its existence guarantees that limits of monotone bounded sequences exist. For example, the set {x ∈ ℚ : x² < 2} is bounded above in ℚ but has no rational supremum; in ℝ, this supremum exists and equals √2. This axiom closes the gaps in the rationals, enabling precise definitions of limits and continuity without ambiguity or incompleteness.</p>

        <p>Cauchy completeness provides an equivalent characterization: every Cauchy sequence in ℝ converges to a limit in ℝ. A sequence (xₙ) is Cauchy if for every ε > 0, there exists N such that |xₘ − xₙ| < ε for all m, n ≥ N. In ℚ, Cauchy sequences need not converge; in ℝ, they always do. This formulation is central to metric space theory and generalizes naturally beyond the real line. The equivalence between the least upper bound property and Cauchy completeness is a fundamental result in real analysis, demonstrating that algebraic and metric perspectives yield the same structure.</p>

        <p>The Archimedean property, a consequence of completeness, states that for any real number x, there exists a natural number n such that n > x. This property ensures that the natural numbers are unbounded in ℝ and that the sequence (1/n) approaches zero. Non-Archimedean ordered fields, such as the hyperreals, contain infinitesimals and infinitely large elements; the Archimedean property excludes such elements from ℝ. The density of the rationals—every interval (a, b) contains a rational—follows from the Archimedean property and the order structure, providing a countable dense subset useful for approximation arguments.</p>

        <p>Construction of the real numbers proceeds via Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences of rationals. A Dedekind cut is a partition of ℚ into two nonempty sets A and B such that every element of A is less than every element of B, with A having no greatest element. Each cut corresponds to a unique real number, either a rational (if B has a least element) or an irrational (otherwise). The Cauchy sequence construction identifies equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in ℚ, defining arithmetic operations and order on these classes. Both constructions yield structures isomorphic to ℝ, confirming the uniqueness of the complete ordered field up to isomorphism.</p>

        <p>The completeness axiom underpins convergence proofs, existence theorems, and topological properties of ℝ. Subsequent articles will explore sequences, limits, continuity, and compactness—all relying on the foundational structure established here. The real numbers provide the stage on which real analysis unfolds, and completeness ensures that the play proceeds without interruption or gaps. Understanding this foundation clarifies why certain theorems hold in ℝ but fail in ℚ, and why the reals remain central to mathematical analysis across disciplines.</p>
