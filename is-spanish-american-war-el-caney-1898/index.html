      <h2>Core Summary</h2>
      <p>On July 1, 1898, while the main American force attacked San Juan Heights, a separate division assaulted the fortified village of El Caney to the north. American commanders expected to take El Caney within two hours and then reinforce the San Juan attack. Instead, a small Spanish garrison of 520 men held off 6,500 Americans for nearly ten hours in one of the war's fiercest fights. Spanish defenders under General Joaquín Vara del Rey fought to the last man, inflicting heavy casualties and disrupting American plans. El Caney became a testament to Spanish courage and the high cost of underestimating a determined enemy.</p>

          <h3>The Flanking Position</h3>
          <p>El Caney sat on the northern approach to Santiago, positioned to threaten the American left flank during any assault on San Juan Heights. General Shafter's battle plan required capturing El Caney quickly to secure his flank and free those troops to reinforce the main attack. Intelligence severely underestimated Spanish strength and determination. What planners dismissed as a minor obstacle became a day-long battle.</p>

          <h3>The Two-Hour Delusion</h3>
          <p>American commanders believed El Caney would fall in two hours maximum. The village seemed lightly defended, and American forces had overwhelming numerical superiority. This fatal miscalculation meant the main attack on San Juan Heights proceeded without the expected reinforcements, while troops intended to support that assault were pinned down at El Caney throughout the critical afternoon.</p>

          <h3>American Attackers</h3>
          <p><strong>General Henry Lawton</strong> commanded roughly 6,500 troops tasked with taking El Caney. This included veteran infantry regiments and artillery support. Despite massive numerical advantage, American forces faced a strongly fortified position and were hampered by poor reconnaissance and inadequate artillery preparation.</p>

          <h3>Spanish Defenders</h3>
          <p><strong>General Joaquín Vara del Rey</strong> commanded only 520 men defending El Caney, but they occupied fortified stone buildings and trenches with excellent fields of fire. Del Rey, a career officer who had fought Cuban insurgents for years, understood that his mission was to delay the Americans as long as possible, even at the cost of annihilation. He and his men accepted certain death to buy time for Santiago's defense.</p>

          <h3>Del Rey's Death and Spanish Resolve</h3>
          <p>When General del Rey was killed at midday, Spanish resistance could have collapsed. Instead, his officers and men continued fighting with undiminished determination. The defense became a point of honor—Spanish troops knew they would die, but they were determined to exact maximum cost from the Americans and delay as long as possible. This heroic resistance exceeded all American expectations.</p>

          <h3>Artillery Finally Arrives</h3>
          <p>After hours of futile infantry assaults, American commanders brought up additional artillery in the afternoon. Heavy bombardment gradually reduced the stone buildings that had sheltered Spanish defenders. Only when their fortifications were pulverized did Spanish resistance finally weaken. The lesson was clear: fortified positions required artillery preparation, not just infantry courage.</p>

          <h3>Immediate Impact</h3>
          <p>Americans eventually captured El Caney but at far higher cost than expected. The delay meant Lawton's troops couldn't reinforce the San Juan Heights attack as planned. Spanish defenders had bought nearly ten hours for Santiago's defense while inflicting disproportionate casualties. Though the position fell, the Spanish defenders achieved their mission through extraordinary sacrifice.</p>

          <h3>Spanish Heroism Recognized</h3>
          <p>Even American commanders praised the defenders of El Caney. General Lawton called it the fiercest fighting he'd seen, including his Civil War experience. Spanish troops turned what should have been a minor action into a legend of courage. General del Rey became a Spanish national hero. The battle proved that Spanish forces, though doomed strategically, could fight with extraordinary bravery and skill.</p>

          <h3>Cost of Underestimation</h3>
          <p>American casualties at El Caney resulted from catastrophic intelligence failure. Commanders assumed they faced light resistance and planned accordingly. The actual strength and determination of Spanish defenders came as a devastating surprise. The battle taught the U.S. Army not to assume enemy weakness—a lesson that would need relearning in future conflicts.</p>

          <h3>The Forgotten Battle</h3>
          <p>While San Juan Hill became famous, El Caney was largely forgotten in American popular memory despite being the harder fight. This reflected American preference for celebrating victories over acknowledging costly struggles. Yet military professionals studied El Caney carefully for its tactical lessons about fortifications, artillery preparation, and the dangers of faulty intelligence.</p>
