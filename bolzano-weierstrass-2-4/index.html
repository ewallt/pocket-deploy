      <h1>Series 2 — Bolzano–Weierstrass</h1>
      <p class="lead">Part 4 · The Theorem Itself</p>

      <article>
        <p>The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem states: every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. To unpack the claim, recall that a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) selects terms along an infinite increasing index list \(n_1 < n_2 < \cdots\). The theorem does not promise that \((x_n)\) converges, only that we can choose a subsequence that does. The limit of this subsequence may depend on the selection, but at least one such limit always exists.</p>

        <p>Several equivalent formulations illuminate the theorem’s reach. One states that every infinite bounded subset of ℝ has an accumulation point—that is, a point where every neighborhood contains infinitely many elements of the set. Another recasts the theorem in terms of sequential compactness: a subset of ℝ is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. These equivalences foreshadow the transition from sequences to topology in Series 3.</p>

        <p>Classical proofs usually deploy a nested interval argument. Starting with a bounded sequence, we place it inside a closed interval. We split the interval into two halves; at least one half contains infinitely many sequence terms. We choose that half and repeat. The nested intervals shrink in length, and completeness of ℝ guarantees that their intersection contains a point \(L\). By selecting one term from the sequence in each chosen interval, we obtain a subsequence converging to \(L\). The theorem’s power stems from this ability to pin down infinitely many terms that cluster together.</p>

        <p>Bolzano originally approached the result via the least upper bound property, while Weierstrass emphasized the sequential perspective. Modern expositions often blend the two, employing completeness to justify the existence of the intersection point and then using sequences to show actual convergence. The interplay between order properties and metric properties is a recurring theme in analysis.</p>

        <p>The theorem’s consequences extend beyond isolated exercises. It underlies the proof that closed intervals are compact, supports Arzelà–Ascoli-type results for function sequences, and ensures that bounded monotone sequences converge. When combined with Cauchy’s criterion for convergence, Bolzano–Weierstrass helps demonstrate that ℝ is complete: every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence, which must converge to the same limit as the original sequence.</p>

        <p>Having stated the theorem, we turn next to the intuition that makes the nested interval argument tick. The upcoming article distills the proof into a mental model centered on bisection, clustering, and the inevitability of convergence inside a shrinking cage.</p>
