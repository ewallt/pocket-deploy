<header class="h"><h1>The Theorem Itself</h1><p class="intro">Statement of Bolzano–Weierstrass: every bounded sequence in ℝ has a convergent subsequence.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem states: If (aₙ) is a bounded sequence of real numbers, then there exists a subsequence (a_{n_k}) that converges to some limit L ∈ ℝ. The hypothesis is boundedness: |aₙ| ≤ M for some M and all n. The conclusion is existence of a convergent subsequence—an infinite selection n₁ < n₂ < n₃ < … such that lim_{k→∞} a_{n_k} = L. The theorem makes no claim about the original sequence converging; it only guarantees that by choosing the right infinite subset of indices, convergence can be achieved. This is an existence statement, often non-constructive—we know such a subsequence exists without necessarily naming the indices explicitly.</p>
<p>Unpacking "subsequence": a subsequence (a_{n_k}) selects terms from (aₙ) in order, so n₁ < n₂ < n₃ < …. Importantly, k goes to infinity, meaning the subsequence is infinite. Picking the first term, the tenth, the hundredth, the thousandth, and so on yields a subsequence. The subsequence inherits properties like boundedness from the parent sequence but can exhibit simpler behavior—oscillations may smooth out, clusters may focus. BWT exploits this flexibility: even if the full sequence is chaotic, a subsequence can be coaxed into convergence by selecting terms that cluster around a limit point.</p>
<p>The limit L may or may not lie in the range of the sequence. Consider (−1)ⁿ: no term equals 0, yet a cleverly chosen subsequence might approach other values (though here the only accumulation points are ±1). For sin(n), the accumulation points are dense in [−1, 1], so different subsequences converge to different limits. BWT guarantees at least one such limit exists; it doesn't claim uniqueness. A bounded sequence can have many accumulation points, and BWT provides a subsequence converging to at least one. The theorem is about existence and possibility, not uniqueness or exhaustiveness.</p>
<p>Boundedness is essential. Consider the sequence aₙ = n, which is unbounded. No subsequence converges to a finite limit; they all tend to infinity. BWT applies only to bounded sequences. In ℝ, boundedness cages the sequence within a compact interval, and compactness forces accumulation points. Without boundedness, sequences can escape to infinity with no convergent subsequence in sight. The theorem's scope is precisely those sequences trapped in a finite region, where completeness of ℝ ensures gaps are filled and clustering occurs.</p>
<p>The real numbers ℝ are crucial. In ℚ, the theorem fails: the sequence of rational approximations to √2 is bounded in ℚ but has no subsequence converging to a rational limit. The subsequences converge to √2, which lies outside ℚ. BWT distinguishes ℝ from incomplete spaces: ℝ is complete, meaning bounded sequences can't cluster around "missing" points—every accumulation point is already in ℝ. This ties BWT to the Completeness Axiom (least upper bound property). The theorem encodes completeness in sequential language: boundedness plus completeness equals guaranteed convergent subsequences.</p>
<p>In summary, BWT asserts that boundedness, though weak, guarantees extractable convergence via subsequences. It is a cornerstone of real analysis, reflecting the interplay between boundedness, compactness, and completeness. The theorem's simplicity belies its power: it underpins existence proofs, connects sequential and topological notions of compactness, and ensures that within any bounded infinite process in ℝ, orderly limiting behavior can be found. It is a promise that infinity, when caged, must accumulate.</p>
