      <h1>Series 2 — Bolzano–Weierstrass</h1>
      <p class="lead">Part 4 · The Theorem Itself</p>

      <article>
        <p>We can now state the theorem that bears Bolzano and Weierstrass’s names: every bounded sequence in \(\mathbb{R}\) has a convergent subsequence. More formally, if \((x_n)\) is a sequence and there exists \(M > 0\) with \(|x_n| \le M\) for all \(n\), then there is a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) and a limit \(L\in\mathbb{R}\) such that \(\lim_{k\to\infty} x_{n_k} = L\). The power of the statement lies in what it promises: even when the original sequence resists convergence, we can extract a convergent thread from its infinite fabric.</p>

        <p>The theorem’s hypothesis and conclusion are both sharp. If we drop boundedness, counterexamples abound: \(x_n = n\) has no convergent subsequence. If we weaken the conclusion to “has a Cauchy subsequence,” the result becomes equivalent because in \(\mathbb{R}\) every Cauchy sequence converges. The interplay between boundedness and completeness is precisely what forces convergence; without completeness (as in \(\mathbb{Q}\)), a bounded sequence can have a Cauchy subsequence converging to an irrational number, which lies outside the space.</p>

        <p>The standard proof follows the nested-interval method. Begin by enclosing the sequence inside an interval \([a_0,b_0]\) that captures all terms. Bisect the interval into \([a_0, m]\) and \([m, b_0]\) where \(m = (a_0 + b_0)/2\). At least one half contains infinitely many sequence elements; choose that half and label it \([a_1,b_1]\). Repeat the process indefinitely, producing a nested sequence of closed intervals whose lengths shrink by a factor of two each time. Completeness tells us the intersection \(\bigcap [a_k,b_k]\) is nonempty and contains a point \(L\).</p>

        <p>To build the subsequence, select indices inductively. Because each interval \([a_k,b_k]\) contains infinitely many terms, we can choose an index \(n_k\) larger than \(n_{k-1}\) with \(x_{n_k} \in [a_k,b_k]\). The resulting subsequence is trapped inside intervals whose diameters approach zero, forcing the terms to converge to \(L\). The ε–N definition confirms this intuition: given any ε, pick \(k\) with \(b_k - a_k < 2\varepsilon\); for all \(j \ge k\), the term \(x_{n_j}\) lies within ε of \(L\).</p>

        <p>This proof highlights the hidden infrastructure supporting the theorem. We rely on the completeness of \(\mathbb{R}\) to guarantee a point in the nested intersection and on the Archimedean property to ensure intervals shrink effectively. The strategy also foreshadows compactness arguments: the nested intervals form a decreasing family of nonempty compact sets whose intersection remains nonempty. Recognizing these themes prepares us for the more abstract framing in Series 3.</p>

        <p>Before tackling that abstraction, the final article in Series 2 distills proof intuition. We will translate the formal steps into a narrative and explore alternative perspectives—including the monotone subsequence theorem—that lead to the same conclusion.</p>
