<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 14 · Philosophical Considerations: Logic, Time, and Possibility</p>
<article>
<p>The debate over Open Theism is not just theological; it is deeply intertwined with philosophical questions about logic, the nature of time, and the meaning of possibility. Open Theists often argue that their position is more philosophically coherent than classical alternatives, particularly regarding the logic of free will and the nature of future events.</p>
<p><strong>The Logic of Future Contingents:</strong>
The core philosophical issue is the status of "future contingents"—propositions about future events that are not yet determined. Consider the statement: "There will be a sea battle tomorrow." In the 4th century BC, Aristotle famously questioned whether this statement could be true or false *today*. If it is true today that the battle will occur, it seems it must occur, making it necessary, not contingent. This is the problem of logical fatalism.
Open Theists essentially adopt an Aristotelian solution: propositions about future contingent events are neither true nor false in the present. They belong to a third category of "indeterminate." If they are not yet true, then there is no truth for an omniscient God to know. Therefore, God's ignorance of future free choices is not a lack in His knowledge but a reflection of the current state of reality. Omniscience is knowing all of reality as it is, and reality includes open possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>The Nature of Time:</strong>
The debate also hinges on different theories of time.
- <strong>A-Theory of Time (Tensed Time):</strong> This view holds that the distinctions between past, present, and future are real and objective. The present moment is ontologically privileged—it is what is "real." The future is not yet real; it is a realm of possibilities. This is the common-sense view of time and is the theory most compatible with Open Theism. A God who exists within an A-Theory timeline would experience events sequentially and see the future as genuinely open.
- <strong>B-Theory of Time (Tenseless Time or "Block Universe"):</strong> This view holds that all moments in time—past, present, and future—are equally real. The flow of time is an illusion of human consciousness. Time is like a four-dimensional block, and all events are already "there." Classical theism, particularly the doctrine of God's timelessness, fits very well with the B-Theory. If the future is as real as the past, then it is fully knowable to a being who can see the entire block.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility and Actuality:</strong>
Open Theism maintains a strong distinction between what is possible and what is actual. Before a free choice is made, multiple outcomes are genuinely possible. When the agent chooses, one of those possibilities becomes actual, and the others cease to be possibilities for that moment. Classical theism, especially in its Calvinist form, tends to collapse this distinction. If God has decreed all that will happen, then only one future is ever truly possible, and everything that is possible will eventually become actual. Molinism attempts to navigate a middle ground with its concept of possible worlds, but Open Theists argue it still ultimately relies on a fixed reality (what creatures *would* do) before that reality is actualized.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Open Theism's theological claims are deeply rooted in specific philosophical commitments: that libertarian free will is the correct view, that propositions about future contingents are not yet true or false, and that time is a real, unfolding process. Their argument is that these commitments provide a more coherent and logically consistent picture than the classical alternatives.</p>
