<header class="h"><h1>The Greeks Desire to See Jesus — Part 3: Losing Life to Keep It</h1><p class="intro">Jesus defines discipleship by the seed’s logic: guarded selves go barren; given selves bear fruit.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>“He who loves his life loses it.” The sentence sounds like subtraction until love translates it. Jesus is not asking for contempt of life; He is unmasking self-preservation as a thief of joy. The shell feels safe, but nothing grows inside it. By contrast, the seed surrendered to soil multiplies exactly because it stops living for itself. The gospel reframes prudence: what we cling to shrinks; what we pour out expands.</p>
<p>“He who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.” The hyperbole targets idolatry, not identity. We are not summoned to self-disgust but to a decisive dethroning of the self as ultimate reference point. The disciple learns to measure choices by love’s good, not ego’s comfort. Paradoxically, this loosening of the grip returns life to us larger, because love opens rooms fear never enters.</p>
<p>“If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there shall My servant be.” Location becomes vocation. To be with Jesus is to show up where love is needed most—near confusion, near grief, near risk. The company He promises is not merely future; it is present companionship in hard places. Service stops being a sidebar to faith and becomes the road where faith breathes.</p>
<p>“The Father will honor him.” The incentive is startling and steadying. We are not gambling on obscurity; we are trading lesser honors for the only applause that matters. Heaven’s honor is not fame but recognition: the Father delights in children who resemble the Son. This future-tense promise stabilizes present-tense decisions when cost rises and applause fades.</p>
<p>Practically, the pattern looks ordinary: time reallocated, status repurposed, resources reassigned. We say no to the shell’s reflex—curate, protect, withhold—and yes to sowing: listening longer, giving quietly, risking reputation to defend the small. None of this is heroic in the moment. It is earthwork for harvests we often will not see, except in the quiet reconfiguration of our own hearts.</p>
<p>Seen from the Greeks’ doorway, this call is also invitation to belonging. The path into the people of God is not gated by pedigree but opened by participation in the Son’s way. Anyone can follow because everyone can love. The seed’s wisdom does not require a platform, only a field. We find ours where we stand—and fall gladly into it.</p>
