<header class="h"><h1>The Cross as Cosmic Evidence</h1><p class="intro">*A public demonstration meant to persuade free minds, not overpower them.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The cross answers the controversy by changing its terms. Instead of contesting claims at the level of assertion, God furnishes evidence at the level of character. The One accused of self-protection chooses self-giving. The One charged with coercion refuses it. What cannot be proved by force is disclosed by fidelity under pressure.</p>
<p>This is evidence for angels as well as humans. The universe watches as love endures betrayal, taunts, injustice, and death without reverting to violence. If God were as the slander claims, Gethsemane would have summoned legions. Instead, the cup is accepted, and the storm spent on Him rather than on His enemies.</p>
<p>Justice, too, is clarified. God does not “let sin slide”; He bears its full consequence—alienation, shame, and the dismantling of life. Yet in bearing it, He refuses to pass it on. The cycle of retaliation ends at the site where nails held Him fast and love held Him more firmly still.</p>
<p>The cross teaches us how God wins. Persuasion replaces pressure; transparency replaces tactics. The open record invites trust precisely because it is costly. Heaven is not safe because God controls every will, but because His will is worthy of every creature’s trust.</p>
<p>As witnesses, we participate by testifying in the same spirit. We tell the truth without rage, serve without calculation, forgive without capitulation to evil. Our lives become exhibits that corroborate the Exhibit.</p>
<p>In the light of Calvary, accusations lose plausibility. The One who would rather die than kill cannot be the tyrant fear imagines. The cosmic court adjourns when this proof is seen as enough.</p>
