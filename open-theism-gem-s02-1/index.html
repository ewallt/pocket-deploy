<p class="lead">Part 6 · Interpreting Predictive Prophecy: Open Theism's Approach</p>
<article>
<p>One of the strongest challenges to Open Theism comes from biblical prophecy. If God does not know the future exhaustively, how can He predict it? The Bible is filled with prophecies that were seemingly fulfilled with great precision, from the fall of empires to the life and death of Jesus Christ. For many, this is definitive proof of God's exhaustive foreknowledge. Open Theists, however, propose a more nuanced model of prophecy that accommodates these texts without requiring an exhaustive-definite view of the future.</p>
<p>First, Open Theists emphasize that a large portion of biblical prophecy is conditional. These prophecies take an "if-then" form, where the outcome depends on human response. A classic example is the book of Jonah. God declares with certainty, "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown." Yet, when the Ninevites repent, God relents and does not bring about the destruction. The prophecy was a genuine warning of what would happen if the people continued on their current path, not an unconditional decree of what must be. Open Theists argue this conditional model is the norm, not the exception.</p>
<p>Second, many prophecies are declarations of God's own intentions. When God promises to deliver Israel from exile, it is a statement of His own commitment and power. Since God is sovereign and powerful, He can ensure that His own plans come to pass. These prophecies do not require knowledge of free human choices, but rather confidence in God's ability to act and direct history toward His goals. God can sovereignly shape the "big picture" of history—like the rise and fall of nations or the coming of the Messiah—without needing to predetermine every individual human choice within that framework.</p>
<p>Third, for prophecies that seem to predict specific free choices (like Peter's denial of Jesus), Open Theists offer several interpretations. Some suggest that God, in His profound wisdom, can predict with near-certainty how a person He knows intimately will act in a given situation, much like we can often predict the actions of a close friend. This is a prediction based on deep knowledge of character, not a pre-known fact. Others propose that in certain rare and pivotal moments, God may sovereignly choose to override or limit human freedom to ensure a crucial part of His plan is fulfilled. Another view is that some events are "brought about" by God's providential guidance of circumstances, making a particular outcome highly probable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Open Theists argue that prophecy is not primarily about demonstrating God's ability to see a fixed future. Instead, its purpose is to call people to repentance, to reveal God's plans and intentions, and to offer hope. It is a tool for guiding and shaping the future in partnership with humanity, not simply for reporting on a future that is already set in stone.</p>
