<header class="h"><h1>Entropy and the Arrow of Time</h1><p>How the second law of thermodynamics turned order into probability.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>In the 19th century, physicists confronted a riddle that pure mechanics could not solve: why does heat flow one way? Newton’s equations were time-symmetric, yet reality was not. Broken eggs do not reassemble, smoke does not unmix. Something deeper governed direction in time.</p>
<p>Rudolf Clausius named it entropy—the measure of energy’s dispersal. The second law of thermodynamics declared that entropy in an isolated system never decreases. This simple rule introduced irreversibility and made decay, not stability, the natural drift of the universe.</p>
<p>Ludwig Boltzmann gave the law a statistical soul. He argued that entropy measures the number of microstates consistent with a macrostate. Disorder is more probable because there are vastly more ways for atoms to be random than orderly. Determinism was replaced by likelihood; the universe’s arrow emerged from counting possibilities.</p>
<p>Boltzmann’s insight was revolutionary but unsettling. It suggested that time’s arrow arises from ignorance, not divine decree. Yet the approach worked: temperature, pressure, and diffusion all became expressions of statistical chance. The clockwork had become a casino.</p>
<p>Still, the old dream persisted. Many physicists hoped that beneath the statistics lay strict mechanics—a deterministic dance of molecules whose unpredictability was merely practical. But the balance had shifted: probability was now in the equations themselves.</p>
<p>By the century’s end, entropy linked physics with cosmology, philosophy, and even culture. The heat death of the universe entered imagination as the ultimate fate of order. Determinism, once triumphant, now shared its throne with chance and time’s irreversible march.</p>
