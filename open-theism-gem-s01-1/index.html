<h1>Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 1 · What is Open Theism? Defining the Core View</p>
<article>
<p>Open Theism is a theological perspective that posits God’s knowledge of future free human actions is not exhaustively settled. Instead, the future, to a degree, is "open," even to God, because genuine human freedom implies that some future events are genuinely contingent possibilities. This view challenges the classical theological understanding of omniscience as complete and exhaustive foreknowledge of all future events, including every free choice. Open Theists argue that God knows all that can be known—past, present, and all genuine possibilities for the future—but that actualizing contingent events is not a subject for knowledge until they occur.</p>
<p>At its core, Open Theism emphasizes a dynamic, relational God who genuinely interacts with creation and responds to the choices of free moral agents. Rather than meticulously orchestrating every detail from eternity past, God is seen as a strategic, wise, and loving actor who engages with the unfolding story of human history. This means that God’s plans can involve alternative possibilities, and His actions can adapt based on human decisions. This perspective aims to preserve the authenticity of human freedom, making choices truly impactful, and prayer a meaningful, rather than predetermined, dialogue with the divine.</p>
<p>Proponents of Open Theism believe that it offers a more robust explanation for certain biblical narratives where God appears to change His mind, express regret, or respond to human entreaties in ways that suggest the future was not entirely fixed. They contend that the traditional concept of exhaustive divine foreknowledge, while affirming God's power, inadvertently diminishes human responsibility and makes God the author of evil, or at least complicit in its inevitability. Open Theism attempts to reconcile divine sovereignty and human free will by adjusting the understanding of God's knowledge, not His power or love.</p>
<p>This view does not deny God's omniscience in the sense of knowing all actualized events and all genuine possibilities. It distinguishes between what is logically knowable and what is not. If a future event genuinely depends on a free human choice, then before that choice is made, it exists as a genuine possibility, not a settled certainty. According to Open Theists, knowing a possibility is different from knowing a certainty. God, in His infinite wisdom, knows precisely what the possibilities are and how to navigate them to achieve His ultimate purposes, even when facing unforeseen choices.</p>
<p>Critics often raise concerns that Open Theism diminishes God's sovereignty or makes Him less than omniscient. However, Open Theists counter that their view enhances God's relational attributes and His active engagement with humanity. They see a God who delights in dialogue, whose love is responsive, and whose purposes are achieved not through coercion but through invitation and partnership with free creatures. This framing aims to paint a picture of God as supremely wise and powerful, yet intimately involved in the drama of an unfolding, genuinely open future.</p>
