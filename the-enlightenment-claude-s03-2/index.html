<h1>The Enlightenment: Revolutions, Critiques, and Legacy</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · The Enlightenment and the French Revolution: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity</p>
<article>
<p>The French Revolution's relationship to the Enlightenment remains one of history's most debated questions. Revolutionary leaders explicitly invoked philosophe principles, citing Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu to justify dismantling the ancien régime. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed Enlightenment commitments to natural rights, popular sovereignty, and legal equality. Revolutionary reforms attacked privilege, established religious toleration, rationalized administration, and promoted meritocracy—goals long championed by philosophes. Yet the Revolution's radical trajectory, culminating in the Terror's mass executions, raised troubling questions about Enlightenment's political implications. Critics argued that abstract rationalism divorced from tradition and custom produced ideological fanaticism and violence. Defenders countered that the Revolution betrayed rather than fulfilled Enlightenment principles when it descended into terror and dictatorship.</p>

<p>Pre-revolutionary France provided fertile ground for Enlightenment ideas to take root and radicalize. Philosophes criticized royal absolutism, aristocratic privilege, and ecclesiastical authority for decades. The Encyclopédie, banned yet widely read, disseminated critical perspectives on existing institutions. Salons and coffeehouses facilitated discussions questioning traditional hierarchies. The educated bourgeoisie—lawyers, merchants, professionals—absorbed Enlightenment principles while resenting their exclusion from political power monopolized by nobility and monarchy. Financial crisis and administrative paralysis demonstrated the ancien régime's inability to reform itself, creating conditions where radical change seemed necessary and possible. When the Estates-General convened in 1789, representatives arrived armed with Enlightenment ideas about rational governance, natural rights, and popular sovereignty, ready to apply these principles to reconstruct French society.</p>

<p>The early Revolution embraced moderate Enlightenment reforms, abolishing feudalism, establishing constitutional monarchy, and proclaiming universal rights. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen echoed Enlightenment texts in asserting that "men are born and remain free and equal in rights" and that government's purpose is preserving "natural and imprescriptible rights of man: liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression." The Constitution of 1791 incorporated separation of powers and representative government. Religious liberty replaced Catholic monopoly. Legal reforms abolished torture and arbitrary arrest. Administrative rationalization created uniform departments replacing historic provinces. These measures reflected Enlightenment confidence that reason could design superior institutions unburdened by irrational tradition. Moderate revolutionaries saw themselves as philosophes with power to implement long-advocated reforms.</p>

<p>As revolution radicalized, competing interpretations of Enlightenment principles fueled political conflict. Girondins emphasized individual rights, representative government, and property protections, drawing on Locke and Montesquieu. Jacobins invoked Rousseau's popular sovereignty and general will to justify direct democracy and suppression of factions opposing the people's presumed interests. Robespierre claimed that revolutionary government must temporarily suspend normal liberties to defeat internal and external enemies, establishing virtue by eliminating vice. The Terror's mass executions, revolutionary tribunals, and ideological surveillance seemed to fulfill philosophe goals of rational reconstruction while violating their commitments to tolerance, moderation, and individual liberty. Whether Jacobin radicalism represented Enlightenment logic taken to extremes or betrayal of Enlightenment principles remains contested.</p>

<p>The Revolution's attack on Christianity demonstrated both Enlightenment influence and departure from philosophe moderation. Revolutionaries confiscated church property, subordinated clergy to state authority through the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and eventually promoted dechristianization campaigns attempting to replace Christianity with the Cult of Reason and later the Cult of the Supreme Being. While Enlightenment thinkers criticized Catholic Church power and dogmatism, most advocated religious tolerance rather than state-imposed irreligion. Voltaire's formula "Écrasez l'infâme" targeted fanaticism, not religion per se. The Revolution's religious policy illustrated how Enlightenment critique of ecclesiastical authority could transform into aggressive secularization and ideological control more extreme than philosophes intended. The attempt to reconstruct society according to rational principles extended to forcing religious transformation.</p>

<p>Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France" articulated influential conservative critique of revolutionary Enlightenment. Burke argued that abstract reason cannot design stable institutions without regard for historical development, custom, and traditional wisdom embedded in inherited practices. He defended prejudice—meaning pre-judgment based on experience—as valuable repository of collective knowledge superior to individual rationalism. Burke warned that destroying existing institutions before developing replacements produces chaos and despotism, as subsequent events seemed to confirm. His critique influenced counter-Enlightenment thought emphasizing tradition, gradual reform, and skepticism toward rationalist social engineering. Burke's conservatism represented one response to revolutionary excesses, arguing that Enlightenment rationalism, however intellectually appealing, proved politically dangerous when applied to complex societies with insufficient regard for continuity and stability.</p>

<p>The French Revolution's ultimate legacy for Enlightenment remains ambiguous. It demonstrated both the power and peril of attempting radical reconstruction based on philosophical principles. Revolutionary achievements—legal equality, religious toleration, administrative rationalization, abolition of feudalism—advanced Enlightenment goals and influenced subsequent political development worldwide. Yet revolutionary violence, ideological fanaticism, and collapse into dictatorship raised enduring questions about reason's role in politics. The Revolution revealed tensions within Enlightenment thought between liberty and equality, individual rights and popular will, gradual reform and revolutionary transformation. These tensions continue shaping political debates over democracy, rights, and social change. Whether the Revolution vindicated or discredited Enlightenment political thought depends on which revolutionary phase one emphasizes and which Enlightenment principles one prioritizes. The relationship between Enlightenment philosophy and revolutionary practice proved far more complex and problematic than philosophes anticipated.</p>
