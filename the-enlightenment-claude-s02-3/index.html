<h1>The Enlightenment: Spreading Ideas and Major Themes</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · Adam Smith and Economic Liberalism: The Wealth of Nations</p>
<article>
<p>Adam Smith's "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations," published in 1776, established political economy as a systematic discipline and articulated principles that would dominate economic thought for generations. Smith sought to explain how nations increase prosperity and what policies best promote economic growth. His central insight was that wealth derives not from accumulating precious metals, as mercantilists believed, but from productive labor creating goods and services. National wealth consists of the total output available for consumption, which increases through improvements in productive efficiency. Smith's analysis challenged mercantilist policies restricting trade and privileging domestic industries, arguing instead that free markets and international commerce maximize prosperity by allowing specialization and exchange according to comparative advantage.</p>

<p>The division of labor stands at the heart of Smith's explanation for economic productivity. His famous example of pin manufacturing illustrated how breaking production into specialized tasks dramatically increases output per worker. When each worker performs all steps—drawing wire, straightening, cutting, sharpening, attaching heads—daily production remains minimal. By contrast, when workers specialize in single operations, coordinating their efforts through exchange, the same number produces vastly more pins. This efficiency gain arises from increased dexterity, time saved by not switching tasks, and opportunities for mechanization of simplified operations. Division of labor extends beyond individual workshops to entire economies as farmers, manufacturers, merchants, and professionals specialize in particular activities, exchanging products through markets. Specialization enables complex societies to achieve productivity impossible in self-sufficient communities.</p>

<p>Smith's concept of the "invisible hand" expressed how individual pursuit of self-interest unintentionally promotes collective welfare when channeled through competitive markets. Individuals seeking profit direct resources toward activities consumers value most, as indicated by prices. A baker produces bread not from benevolence but to earn income, yet consumers benefit from available bread at competitive prices. Competition compels producers to improve quality and reduce costs, as inefficient firms lose customers to rivals. Market prices coordinate countless individual decisions without central direction, allocating resources more effectively than government planning. This spontaneous order arises from institutional frameworks—property rights, contract enforcement, rule of law—that enable peaceful exchange. Smith's invisible hand suggested that prosperity emerges from properly structured institutions allowing self-interest to serve social good, not from bureaucratic control or aristocratic patronage.</p>

<p>Smith advocated free trade and opposed mercantilist restrictions like tariffs, import quotas, and monopolies granted to favored companies. Mercantilism assumed trade was zero-sum, with one nation's gain necessarily another's loss, justifying policies to maximize exports and minimize imports. Smith demonstrated that voluntary exchange benefits both parties by allowing each to obtain goods more cheaply through trade than through domestic production. Specialization according to comparative advantage—producing goods one makes relatively efficiently—increases total output available to trading partners. Protectionist policies benefiting particular industries impose costs on consumers and distort resource allocation. Smith's free trade arguments provided intellectual foundation for nineteenth-century liberal commercial policies and remain central to debates over globalization. His critique of mercantilism extended to skepticism about government economic intervention generally.</p>

<p>Despite his reputation as apostle of laissez-faire, Smith acknowledged important governmental responsibilities beyond enforcing contracts and protecting property. Governments must provide national defense, since private markets under-supply public goods whose benefits cannot be restricted to paying customers. They should fund infrastructure like roads and harbors that facilitate commerce but may not attract private investment due to long payback periods. Education warrants public support because an informed citizenry benefits society beyond individual returns. Smith also recognized that economic power could threaten liberty, warning against business collusion to raise prices or lower wages. He supported regulations preventing fraud and protecting vulnerable parties. His vision of limited government focused on creating conditions for markets to function effectively, not abolishing all public economic activity.</p>

<p>Smith's moral philosophy, articulated earlier in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," complemented his economic analysis by examining foundations of ethical judgment. He argued that moral sentiments arise from sympathy—our capacity to imaginatively enter others' situations and share their feelings. We approve actions we would sympathize with if we occupied the agent's position and judge conduct by imagining how impartial spectators would view it. This account grounded ethics in natural human psychology rather than divine command or rational intuition. Smith believed commercial society cultivated virtues like prudence, industry, and honesty while softening martial and aristocratic values. Critics argued that Smith's economics celebrated selfishness contradicting his ethics, but Smith saw properly channeled self-interest as compatible with, even conducive to, moral society when institutional frameworks align private and public good.</p>

<p>Smith's influence on economic thought and policy proved immense. Classical economists like David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill developed his theories further, refining concepts and exploring implications. His work provided intellectual justification for industrial capitalism and liberal reforms dismantling guild restrictions, corn laws, and mercantilist regulations. Free trade advocacy influenced British policy in the nineteenth century, though actual implementation remained partial and contested. Smith's reputation has been invoked by diverse political movements, from libertarians opposing government intervention to progressives noting his concerns about inequality and business power. While modern economics has grown more mathematically sophisticated and incorporated insights Smith lacked, his fundamental insights about specialization, comparative advantage, and market coordination remain foundational. His synthesis of economic analysis, moral philosophy, and policy prescription exemplified Enlightenment ambitions to apply reason to social questions.</p>
