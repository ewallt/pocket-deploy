<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis, History, and Key Debates</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 8 · Key New Testament Texts: Divine Knowledge and Human Agency</p>
<article>
<p>The New Testament presents a different set of challenges and proof-texts in the debate over Open Theism. While the Old Testament often emphasizes God's responsive nature, the New Testament contains significant passages about foreknowledge, predestination, and God's sovereign plan, which are cornerstones for the classical view. Open Theists must offer compelling interpretations of these texts to maintain their position.</p>
<p>Texts on "foreknowledge" (*prognōsis* in Greek) are central. In <strong>Romans 8:29</strong>, Paul writes, "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son." Classical theists interpret "foreknew" as God's cognitive awareness of who would believe. Open Theists, however, often argue that the biblical concept of "knowing" (both *yāda* in Hebrew and *ginōskō* in Greek) implies a relational intimacy, not just intellectual apprehension. Thus, to "foreknow" is to "fore-love" or to enter into a relationship with someone in advance. It is about God's relational choice, not passive observation of a future decision.</p>
<p>The concept of predestination is also crucial. Passages like <strong>Ephesians 1:4-5</strong> state that God "chose us in him before the foundation of the world...he predestined us for adoption." Open Theists typically interpret this corporately rather than individually. That is, God predestined a *plan* of salvation and a *people* (the Church, "in Christ"), but individuals are free to choose whether or not to join that group. The destination is predestined, but the choice of who gets on board is a matter of free will.</p>
<p>However, the New Testament also contains passages that support an Open perspective. The emphasis on prayer is a key example. Throughout the Gospels and Epistles, prayer is presented as a genuine means of changing outcomes. In <strong>James 4:2</strong>, it says, "You do not have, because you do not ask." This suggests that the future can be different depending on whether or not people pray. If the future were exhaustively settled, petitionary prayer would be, at best, a means of aligning oneself with God's predetermined will, not a tool for actually changing what will happen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jesus's parables and exhortations often hinge on the importance of human choice and watchfulness for an unknown future. The language of "if" is prevalent in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, implying that the future is contingent on human response. For example, Paul often speaks of the possibility of believers falling away from the faith (e.g., 1 Corinthians 9:27), which seems to presuppose a future that is not yet settled. For Open Theists, the New Testament's call to discipleship, evangelism, and prayer makes the most sense in a world where human choices genuinely shape the future in collaboration with God.</p>
