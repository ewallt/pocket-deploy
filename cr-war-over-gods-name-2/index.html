<header class="h"><h1>The Great Controversy</h1><p class="intro">*Accusation meets revelation; the issue is God’s character.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The controversy is “great” not merely in scale but in stakes. At issue is whether the Sovereign of all uses power to preserve reputation or love to preserve relationship. The adversary alleges that obedience is sustained by reward and threat, that freedom is a veneer, and that God’s law is a cage dressed as care.</p>
<p>God answers by opening His dealings to view. Instead of crushing the slander, He invites scrutiny: providence traced through promise, patience, and fulfilled word. The record accumulates across centuries so that trust may rest on history, not hype. Revelation is not a data dump but a life lived before witnesses.</p>
<p>In this war, weapons differ. The accuser trades in insinuation, selective memory, and spectacle. God wields truth, mercy, and faithfulness. Even when judgment comes, it is proportioned to healing aims, restrained by appeals, and explained in advance. Nothing is arbitrary; everything is relational.</p>
<p>The cross becomes the turning point because it concentrates the argument. If God were self-protective, Calvary would be impossible. If love is the law of life, Calvary is inevitable. There, the logic of heaven stands revealed: better to suffer wrong than to commit it; better to absorb hate than to perpetuate it.</p>
<p>The controversy continues wherever God’s character is misread. Communities that mirror coercion, secrecy, and pride strengthen the accusation; those that embody patience, transparency, and service become living rebuttals. The church participates by the kind of life it lives, not the slogans it repeats.</p>
<p>When the war ends, it will be because the evidence is enough for free beings to rest their case. Victory is the restoration of trust—the Name hallowed, the lie exposed, and love recognized as the only safe foundation for eternity.</p>
