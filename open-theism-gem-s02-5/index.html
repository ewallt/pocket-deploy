<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis, History, and Key Debates</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 10 · Open Theism vs. Classical Theism: Contrasting Views of God's Attributes</p>
<article>
<p>The debate between Open Theism and Classical Theism is fundamentally a disagreement over the nature of God's attributes. While both affirm God's greatness, they define that greatness in significantly different ways. This contrast is most apparent in their views on omniscience, immutability, impassibility, and timelessness.</p>
<p><strong>Omniscience (All-Knowing):</strong>
- <em>Classical Theism:</em> God possesses exhaustive definite foreknowledge (EDF). He knows all true propositions about the past, present, and future with perfect, infallible certainty. The future is as settled and known to God as the past.
- <em>Open Theism:</em> God knows all of the past and present with perfect certainty, and He knows all future possibilities. However, He does not know the future choices of free creatures as settled facts. The future is partly "open," and God's omniscience means knowing reality as it is—a mix of settled facts and open possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Immutability (Unchanging):</strong>
- <em>Classical Theism:</em> God is absolutely unchanging in His being, will, and knowledge. He cannot be acted upon by anything external to Himself. His plans are eternal and do not change. Biblical descriptions of God changing His mind are considered anthropomorphisms.
- <em>Open Theism:</em> God is unchanging in His core character, nature, and promises (He is eternally loving, just, and faithful). However, His plans and experiences can change in response to His interactions with creation. He is steadfast in His character but dynamic in His relationship with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Impassibility (Unemotional/Unmoved):</strong>
- <em>Classical Theism:</em> God is without passions or emotions that are caused by the actions of others. He does not "suffer" in the sense of being involuntarily affected by creation. His love and wrath are willed actions, not reactive emotions.
- <em>Open Theism:</em> God is deeply passible and relational. He is genuinely affected by the world. He feels joy, grief, and compassion in response to human actions. The suffering of humanity genuinely touches the heart of God. This view takes biblical descriptions of God's emotions literally.</p>
<p><strong>Timelessness vs. Everlastingness:</strong>
- <em>Classical Theism:</em> God exists outside of time (atemporal). He does not experience events sequentially. Past, present, and future are all simultaneously present to Him in an "eternal now."
- <em>Open Theism:</em> God is everlasting (sempiternal). He exists within time, but He has no beginning and no end. He experiences events in sequence, which allows for a genuine "before and after" in His relationship with the world. This temporal nature is necessary for Him to be truly responsive.</p>
<p>In essence, Classical Theism prioritizes God's self-sufficiency, sovereignty, and unchanging perfection, often drawing from Greek philosophical concepts of perfection. Open Theism, by contrast, prioritizes God's relational nature, love, and responsiveness, arguing that its view is more faithful to the narrative portrayal of God in the Hebrew scriptures. The choice between them often depends on which set of divine attributes one considers to be most fundamental.</p>
