<header class="h"><h1>The Fire Misread as Hell</h1><p class="intro">*Judgment is presence unfiltered—misery for rebellion, mercy for the willing.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Much Christian imagination treats hell as a separate torture, fueled by a wrath that finally loses patience. Scripture’s imagery points in a different direction. The same glory that transfigures also terrifies; the same light that heals the willing exposes the unrepentant. The fire is <em>God Himself</em>, not an invention outside of Him.</p>
<p>When this is forgotten, divine justice appears arbitrary, as though love keeps one face for friends and another for enemies. But the faces are ours. To hearts trained by selfishness, uncreated Light feels like pain—the ache of truth colliding with refusal. The pain is diagnostic, not vindictive.</p>
<p>Jesus’ parables underline this. Weeping and gnashing occur at the threshold of joy, not in a separate universe—the feast is open, the door is bright, and resentment refuses to enter. Exclusion becomes self-chosen alienation from a joy we will not share.</p>
<p>The Cross proves what God does with enemies: He bears their violence and prays for them. If the final fire were cruelty, Calvary would be a rehearsal. Instead it is revelation—Love laid bare, refusing coercion, enduring rejection, and letting darkness spend itself.</p>
<p>To preach judgment truly is to preach the unchanging goodness of God. His presence is paradise to those who welcome it and anguish to those who cling to self. He does not change between rooms; we do.</p>
<p>This reading restores moral sense to the symbols. God is not a criminal arsonist; He is the Sun. Life flourishes in His light or withers outside it. Judgment simply shows which we have preferred.</p>
