<header class="h"><h1>The Greeks Desire to See Jesus — Part 5: Lifted Up to Draw All</h1><p class="intro">The answer to the nations’ request is the cross: an elevation that reveals, reconciles, and attracts without coercion.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>“When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.” The verb gathers Good Friday and Ascension into one arc—crucified then exalted, shame transfigured into signal. The “draw” is not drag. It is the magnetism of unveiled love, strong enough for the stubborn, gentle enough for the bruised. From the Greeks’ courtyard to the ends of the earth, this is the sightline God clears.</p>
<p>The cross unknots questions that arguments keep tightening. What is God like? Look there: suffering with us and for us; refusing shortcuts; telling the truth without violence; forgiving enemies He could crush. What is sin like? Look there: exposed as cruelty to the innocent and as contempt for the good. What is salvation like? Look there: reconciliation achieved by self-giving, not appeasement extracted by fear.</p>
<p>The universality of the draw does not erase particularity. The same Jesus who fulfills Israel’s story becomes the world’s Savior precisely by being Israel’s Messiah. The graft remains botanical: nations are welcomed into a living root, not into a vague spirituality. The church therefore holds both notes—faithful to Scripture’s plot and wide open to strangers who arrive mid-song.</p>
<p>To participate in the draw is to practice cruciform visibility. We lift Him up in humble words and sacrificial deeds, refusing manipulation. We carry our small crosses—costly kindness, truth under pressure, hospitality that stretches budgets—trusting that the Spirit makes such signs legible. Our goal is not to win attention to ourselves but to clear sightlines to the One who saves.</p>
<p>Some will object, as the crowd did, that the Messiah must remain forever and cannot be “lifted up.” Jesus responds by inviting them to walk in the light they have, lest darkness argue them into paralysis. Faith rarely begins with full diagrams; it begins with steps toward the Light. The cross will soon clarify what the prophecy meant and what the kingdom requires.</p>
<p>At last the request—“we would see Jesus”—is granted beyond expectation. The nations will see Him high and near, judged and vindicated, rejected and reigning. And in the long wake of that vision, idols loosen, enemies reconcile, and weary souls learn rest. The seed falls; the harvest moves; the world is being drawn.</p>
