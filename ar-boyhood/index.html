But for the kids of Mission Hills and the families who discovered it in the 1960s, Presidio Hills was magic.",

                        "content": "The heart and soul of Presidio Hills was Al Abrego, the head pro whose family had been running the course since it opened in 1932. Al had a gift for teaching children, and his patient voice could be heard across the greens every afternoon: <strong>‘A one, a two, and a three!’</strong> That rhythmic counting became as much a part of the course as the pepper trees that lined Juan Street. Al had started his ‘Tiny Tots’ program back in the thirties, taking kids as young as four and teaching them not just how to swing a club, but how to love the game. <strong>‘Golf is about patience,’</strong> he’d tell the children, many of whom would remember his lessons sixty years later. <strong>‘You learn patience here, you can handle anything life throws at you.’</strong> The course was in beautiful shape then, green and well-maintained, a perfect little classroom for the fundamentals of the game."

                        "content": "What made Presidio Hills special wasn’t its length—no hole was longer than 94 yards—but its character. There was the hole with the tree right in the middle of the fairway that you had to hit over or around, teaching young players to think creatively. There was the ridiculously short hole, maybe fifteen or twenty yards, that looked easy until you tried to land a ball softly on the tiny green. Kids could reach most holes with a simple chip shot, but William Park Bell, the architect who designed the course, had used the natural hills and hollows to create real challenges for the short game. Every hole had a lesson to teach, whether it was about club selection, reading greens, or just having the courage to take your time when everyone was watching."

The course was a democratic place where a businessman from downtown might find himself paired with a retired fisherman from Point Loma, both of them equally humbled by the deceptively simple par-3s. There was Mrs. Patterson, who’d never been much of an athlete but took up golf to spend time with her husband, and who’ll always remember the day she hit a shot on the 18th hole that disappeared from sight and turned out to be a hole-in-one. <strong>‘I didn’t even know where it went,’</strong> she’d laugh, telling the story years later. <strong>‘I thought I’d lost another ball.’</strong>"

It was a strange thing, this ancient adobe building serving sodas and golf balls to suburban families, but somehow it worked. The thick walls kept the interior cool even on the hottest summer days, and the old building gave the little course a dignity that newer facilities couldn’t match. Kids would sit on the steps of the clubhouse, drinking Cokes and comparing scorecards, surrounded by more than a century of California history. Al Abrego would tell them stories sometimes about the famous golfers who’d played there—Phil Mickelson was just another neighborhood kid when he started coming around, and Tiger Woods would win junior tournaments on these same greens. But for the children of the sixties, those names meant nothing yet. They were just learning that golf was about more than hitting a ball into a hole. It was about tradition, patience, and the quiet satisfaction of a game played well."

Families would drive up the winding road to the park, kids pressed against car windows to catch the first glimpse of the tower that seemed to float above the city like something from a Spanish dream. The museum, designed to look like the old missions, housed artifacts and exhibits about the early days of California, but for most children, the real attraction was the view from the tower and the wide green spaces perfect for running around after being told to be quiet in the museum."

Mrs. Eleanor Thompson, who volunteered as a docent on weekends, had a gift for making history come alive for young visitors. <strong>‘Imagine this hill covered with soldiers and priests,’</strong> she’d tell wide-eyed children, <strong>‘and no city below, just fields and the river and the bay stretching out to the ocean.’</strong> She’d lived in San Diego long enough to remember when the museum was new, and she never tired of watching children discover that their hometown had a story that went back centuries."

The park had several distinct areas—Inspiration Point with its mature trees and panoramic views, the Arbor with its Corinthian columns where couples sometimes held wedding ceremonies, and the area around the Padre Cross monument where children would run between the old foundations while their parents tried to keep track of them. There was something magical about eating sandwiches in a place where Spanish soldiers had once stood guard, watching for ships on the horizon."

Frank Martinez, who worked at the shipyards and lived in Logan Heights, would bring his children up the hill on summer evenings just to watch the sun set over the Pacific. <strong>‘This is your city,’</strong> he’d tell them, gesturing toward the lights below. <strong>‘Learn its history, respect where it came from.’</strong> The kids would chase each other around the monuments while the adults sat quietly, watching San Diego transform from a daytime city of business and traffic into an evening city of lights and possibilities. It was a place that reminded everyone, children and adults alike, that they were part of something larger than themselves—a story that had been unfolding for two hundred years and was still being written."

Families would pack station wagons with coolers and beach umbrellas, towels and sunscreen, knowing they were heading to a beach that felt more like a secret than a destination. The road curved up through the rare Torrey Pine trees, and then suddenly you’d crest the hill and see it spread out below—a perfect crescent of sand backed by golden cliffs, with the blue Pacific stretching to the horizon. <strong>‘It’s like we’re the first people to discover it,’</strong> kids would say, and in a way, they were right. Torrey Pines was still wild then, still empty enough that a family could claim their own piece of paradise for the day."

The cliffs provided perfect updrafts for the hang gliders who would launch themselves into space, riding the wind currents like modern Icaruses. Children would spend hours watching the colorful wings catch the thermals, soaring and diving above the waves with a grace that seemed impossible. The Torrey Pines Golf Course, perched on the cliffs above the beach, was already gaining a reputation as one of the world’s most beautiful courses, though most families knew it only as the place where you parked before scrambling down the trails to the beach. The contrast was perfect—the manicured greens above and the wild beach below, civilization and nature sharing the same spectacular piece of coastline."

Fathers would spend the first part of every beach day explaining to their children about rip currents and undertows, about how the ocean could be beautiful and dangerous at the same time. But for kids who learned to read the waves, Torrey Pines offered some of the best body surfing in San Diego. There was something pure about catching a wave with nothing but your own body, riding it toward shore while feeling the power of the Pacific beneath you. <strong>‘The ocean teaches you respect,’</strong> said Jim Walsh, a lifeguard who worked the beach in those days. <strong>‘Kids who learn that lesson here, they carry it with them for life.’</strong>"

The park’s rangers would patrol occasionally, but mostly they left people alone to enjoy what felt like the last untouched piece of the Southern California coast. As the sun set behind the cliffs and the gliders packed up their wings for the day, families would shake the sand from their blankets and load their cars, already planning their return to this perfect place where time seemed to move a little slower and the world felt a little bigger."

It’s something that connects us all.’</strong> Old Town was where San Diego’s children learned that their city had roots deeper than the Navy bases and aerospace plants, deeper even than the Spanish missions.

Teachers like Mrs. Morrison, who’d been at Grant for twenty years, knew not just their current students but their older siblings and sometimes their parents too."

There was Mr. Henderson, the sixth-grade teacher who had a gift for making history come alive through storytelling. He’d regale his students with tales from his own childhood, like the time he tried to fake being asleep when his parents came to check on him, snoring <strong>‘snark snare-oh! snark snare-oh!’</strong> so convincingly that he fooled no one but entertained everyone. These stories weren’t just time-killers; they were lessons in human nature, in the art of storytelling, and in the idea that teachers were real people with real experiences, not just authority figures in dress clothes."

Teachers abandoned their lesson plans and led their classes outside to witness the miracle of frozen precipitation. Children who had lived their entire lives in a climate where the biggest weather excitement was the occasional rainstorm stood in wonderment as white flakes drifted down from a gray sky. Fourth-grade teacher Miss Kelly gathered her class around her and announced with the gravity of a nature documentary narrator: <strong>‘Class, this is snow.’</strong> Some children tried to catch flakes on their tongues, others attempted to build miniature snowmen from the thin dusting that accumulated on playground benches, and all of them understood that they were experiencing something rare and magical."

The school served hot lunch in a cafeteria where the lunch ladies knew every child’s preferences and dietary restrictions, and where the smell of institutional food was somehow comforting rather than off-putting. After school, children would walk home through neighborhoods where they felt safe and where adults looked out for all the local kids, not just their own. It was an education in community as much as academics, preparing children not just for high school and college, but for a lifetime of civic engagement and social responsibility."

But for the families who visited on weekend afternoons, the revolution in zoological science was less important than the simple magic of seeing a polar bear swim underwater or watching a family of gorillas interact behind the glass of their enclosure. Dr. Schroeder, who could often be found walking the zoo grounds and talking with visitors, believed that people would only care about saving wildlife if they first learned to love it. <strong>‘Every child who falls in love with an animal here,’</strong> he’d say, <strong>‘becomes a conservationist for life.’</strong>"

Children would press their faces against the gondola windows, marveling at the zoo spread out below them like a green oasis in the middle of the city. For families with young children or elderly grandparents, the guided bus tours provided a comfortable way to see the entire zoo while learning about the animals from knowledgeable guides who seemed to have endless stores of fascinating facts. <strong>‘Did you know that a giraffe’s tongue is 18 inches long?’</strong> they’d ask, delighting in the gasps of amazement from their young passengers."

The animal shows at the zoo’s amphitheater were another highlight, featuring trained sea lions, exotic birds, and educational demonstrations that taught children about animal behavior while entertaining them. Mrs. Betty Sullivan, who brought her children to the zoo at least once a month, would remember watching her daughter’s face light up the first time she saw a elephant paint a picture with its trunk. <strong>‘That’s when she decided she wanted to work with animals,’</strong> Mrs. Sullivan would recall years later. <strong>‘The zoo didn’t just entertain her—it inspired her.’</strong>"

The animals came from Africa, Asia, South America—places that seemed as exotic as other planets to kids who’d never been farther from home than Los Angeles. The zoo’s educational programs taught them about different climates and ecosystems, about the interconnectedness of all life on Earth, and about their responsibility as human beings to protect the natural world. School field trips to the zoo were annual traditions, with teachers using the visit to supplement classroom lessons about geography, biology, and conservation. It was education disguised as entertainment, learning that happened naturally through wonder and curiosity. For many children, a day at the San Diego Zoo was their first step toward becoming global citizens, people who understood that their local community was part of a much larger, more diverse, and more beautiful world."

In the 1960s, the coaster was already considered a classic, its wooden frame weathered by decades of salt air but still solid enough to provide heart-stopping drops and curves that left riders both terrified and exhilarated. Children would spend the entire car ride to Mission Beach building up courage to ride the Giant Dipper, and parents would find themselves torn between wanting to protect their kids from genuine fear and knowing that conquering that fear was part of growing up. <strong>‘You only live once,’</strong> fathers would tell nervous children waiting in line. <strong>‘And you’ll regret it forever if you don’t try.’</strong>"

The prizes hanging above the game booths—enormous stuffed animals, transistor radios, plastic toys from Japan—seemed impossibly wonderful to children who’d never learned to calculate the odds of actually winning them. There was always some teenager who claimed to have mastered the secret of the ring toss or the milk bottles, and younger kids would gather around to watch them demonstrate their supposed expertise, usually with disappointing results. But hope sprang eternal on the midway, and every child was convinced that this time would be different, this time they’d win the giant panda that was almost as big as they were."

The salt air mixed with the smell of popcorn and cotton candy, and the sound of waves crashing competed with the mechanical music of the carousel and the screams of delight from the roller coaster. Children would spend the day moving back and forth between the beach and the amusement park, building sandcastles in the morning, riding rides in the afternoon, and watching the sunset from the Giant Dipper in the evening. It was the perfect synthesis of Southern California beach culture and traditional American amusement park fun."

Parents would watch from benches with bags full of beach towels and sunscreen, occasionally checking their watches to make sure they weren’t staying too late, but mostly just enjoying the sight of their children having pure, uncomplicated fun. The Plunge, the large indoor swimming pool adjacent to the park, provided an alternative for families who wanted to swim without dealing with sand and surf, and many children have memories of birthday parties held in the warm, echoing space of the natatorium. Belmont Park in the 1960s was a place where childhood dreams came true one ride at a time, where the simple pleasure of a day at the beach was amplified by the added excitement of carnival rides and games. It was quintessential Southern California—casual, fun-loving, and always touched by the magic of being so close to the ocean that you could hear the waves no matter which ride you were on."
