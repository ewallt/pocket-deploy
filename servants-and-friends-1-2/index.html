<header class="h"><h1>Can We Be Friends with God?</h1><p class="intro">Abraham was called “the friend of God” — a title offered to every trusting heart.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Friendship is mutual trust between equals, so how can finite humans be friends with the Infinite? Maxwell answers that God Himself made the offer. Jesus told His disciples, “I no longer call you servants, but friends.” To be a friend of God is to enter a relationship based not on fear or favor, but on trust and shared purpose.</p>
<p>Throughout Scripture, God treats people as moral beings capable of conversation and choice. He invites dialogue and even disagreement, as when He reasoned with Abraham over Sodom. This dialogue is the hallmark of friendship — a relationship safe enough for honesty.</p>
<p>Servant religion reduces obedience to command-keeping without understanding. Friendship with God honors freedom; He wants children, not slaves. Trust transforms duty into delight.</p>
<p>When Jesus called His followers friends, He was revealing how God has always related to His people. Even the law, rightly understood, is a description of how friends of God live.</p>
<p>The enemy’s goal is to distort that friendship into fear. The Spirit’s work is to restore our confidence in God’s goodness so that love once again casts out fear and friendship flourishes forever.</p>
