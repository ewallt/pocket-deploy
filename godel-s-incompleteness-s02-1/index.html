<h1>Gödel's Incompleteness: Proof Sketch</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 1 · Gödel Numbering: Arithmeticizing Syntax</p>
<article>
<p>The key innovation in Gödel's proof is Gödel numbering, a technique that assigns a unique natural number to every symbol, formula, and proof in a formal system. This encoding transforms syntax—strings of symbols—into arithmetic objects—natural numbers. Once formulas and proofs are represented as numbers, the formal system can make statements about its own structure using ordinary arithmetic. Properties like "formula F is provable" or "sequence S is a valid proof" become arithmetic predicates, expressible within the system itself. This self-referential capacity is the linchpin of the incompleteness theorem. Gödel numbering demonstrates that arithmetic is rich enough to encode and reason about formal logic, blurring the line between mathematics and meta-mathematics.</p>

<p>Gödel numbering begins by assigning unique numbers to the basic symbols of the formal language. For example, in Peano Arithmetic, one might assign: 0 → 1, S (successor) → 2, + → 3, × → 4, = → 5, ¬ (not) → 6, ∧ (and) → 7, ∨ (or) → 8, → (implies) → 9, ∀ (for all) → 10, ∃ (there exists) → 11, variables x₁, x₂, x₃, ... → 12, 13, 14, ..., and parentheses and other punctuation symbols to subsequent numbers. The specific assignment is arbitrary, as long as it is one-to-one (each symbol gets a unique number). With symbols numbered, formulas—finite sequences of symbols—can be encoded as single natural numbers using a systematic method, such as prime factorization or concatenation of digit strings.</p>

<p>One elegant encoding uses prime factorization. Given a formula as a sequence of symbols s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ with Gödel numbers g₁, g₂, ..., gₙ, the Gödel number of the formula is 2^(g₁) · 3^(g₂) · 5^(g₃) ·...· pₙ^(gₙ), where pₙ is the n-th prime. For example, the formula ∀x₁ (S(x₁) = S(x₁)) might have the sequence of symbol numbers 10, 12, 7, 2, 7, 12, 8, ... (depending on exact encoding rules). Its Gödel number would be the product of primes raised to these exponents. This number uniquely encodes the formula: by factoring, one recovers the sequence of exponents, hence the symbols, hence the original formula. Every formula has a unique Gödel number, and every Gödel number corresponds to at most one formula (some numbers may not encode valid formulas).</p>

<p>Proofs, which are sequences of formulas, are similarly encoded. If a proof consists of formulas F₁, F₂, ..., Fₖ with Gödel numbers n₁, n₂, ..., nₖ, the Gödel number of the proof is another product of primes: 2^(n₁) · 3^(n₂) · 5^(n₃) ·...· pₖ^(nₖ). Since formulas themselves have Gödel numbers (potentially large), the Gödel number of a proof can be enormous. Nonetheless, it is a well-defined natural number. Given a number, one can algorithmically determine whether it encodes a valid proof: factor it, extract the sequence of formula numbers, check that each formula is either an axiom or follows from earlier formulas by a rule of inference. This checking process is purely arithmetical, manipulating and comparing natural numbers.</p>

<p>With Gödel numbering in place, meta-mathematical concepts become arithmetic predicates. "Formula F is an axiom" translates to "the Gödel number of F satisfies a certain arithmetic property" (e.g., it factors in a way matching an axiom template). "There exists a proof of F" translates to "there exists a natural number p such that p encodes a valid proof of the formula with Gödel number equal to F's Gödel number." These translations are mechanical but intricate. Gödel showed that such predicates can be expressed in the language of arithmetic using only quantifiers, addition, and multiplication. The predicate "Prov(x)" meaning "x is the Gödel number of a provable formula" is definable within PA, though it involves complex arithmetic expressing the structure of proofs.</p>

<p>The expressibility of Prov(x) within arithmetic is remarkable: the formal system can "talk about" its own provability. This self-reference is not circular or paradoxical in itself—Prov(x) is simply a complicated arithmetic formula, involving quantifiers and exponentiation-like operations. However, it enables the construction of self-referential statements. Gödel used Prov(x) to build a formula G that effectively asserts "the formula with Gödel number g is not provable," where g is G's own Gödel number. This is analogous to the sentence "This sentence is not provable," formalized rigorously through arithmetic encoding. The ability to construct such sentences rests entirely on Gödel numbering, which bridges syntax and semantics within a single arithmetical framework.</p>

<p>Gödel numbering has become a foundational tool in mathematical logic and computer science. It demonstrates that formal systems can be encoded as data, enabling programs to manipulate and reason about programs—a concept central to computability theory, compilers, and metamathematics. Turing's work on the Halting Problem uses similar encoding ideas: programs and inputs are represented as numbers, and questions about program behavior become arithmetic questions. Gödel numbering reveals the deep unity between logic, arithmetic, and computation. By arithmeticizing syntax, Gödel showed that formal systems contain within themselves the capacity for self-examination, leading inexorably to incompleteness. This encoding technique, elegant and powerful, remains one of the most ingenious ideas in 20th-century mathematics, transforming abstract logic into concrete arithmetic and making the unprovable provably true.</p>
