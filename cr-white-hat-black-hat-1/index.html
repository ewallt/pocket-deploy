<header class="h"><h1>The Myth of the Clean Hero</h1><p class="intro">*How Westerns turned moral contrast into moral confusion.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Saturday-afternoon Westerns trained consciences with stark images: a white hat signals virtue, a black hat signals vice. Townsfolk are decent and defenseless; outlaws are cruel and efficient; a lone rider appears to set things right. Everything looks clear enough to be taught to a child—and that is exactly where the danger begins.</p>
<p>Because as the story moves, the “good guy” triumphs not by keeping the law but by breaking it better. He lies to trap the villain, he ambushes before being ambushed, and he kills quickly to “save the town.” The audience applauds the result and forgives the methods. Moral arithmetic replaces moral vision.</p>
<p>This formula works because it feels safe: evil meets a stronger version of itself and loses. But the lesson that seeps in is more subtle: righteousness succeeds by borrowing the villain’s tools. The trope sells a compromise as if it were courage and names it justice.</p>
<p>Scripture calls that logic a lie. God’s government does not preserve the law by suspending it; it vindicates the law by embodying it. When ends and means diverge, truth is already defeated. The cross will expose this inversion by defeating violence without using it.</p>
<p>To unlearn the myth, we begin by noticing how our imaginations were formed. What felt like innocence was liturgy. The hat colors were never enough; the methods were always the message. And the message taught us to cheer for something Christ never does.</p>
<p>So this series starts with suspicion toward the “clean hero.” If the means are unclean, the hero is not clean at all—no matter his wardrobe.</p>
