<header class="h"><h1>Uncertainty and Complementarity</h1><p>Heisenberg and Bohr redraw the boundaries between knowledge and reality.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>By 1927, Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle shattered the last refuge of classical predictability. It stated that one cannot simultaneously know a particle’s position and momentum with arbitrary precision. Measurement itself disturbed what it sought to reveal. Nature was not merely unknown—it was indeterminate until observed.</p>
<p>Niels Bohr extended this insight into his principle of complementarity. Light and electrons could act as particles or waves, but never both at once. Description depended on context; objectivity required accepting mutually exclusive perspectives. Reality was richer and stranger than any single picture could capture.</p>
<p>This new philosophy of science replaced Laplace’s omniscient demon with a humbler observer. Knowledge became participatory, bound to the interaction between instrument and system. The observer entered the equation.</p>
<p>For Einstein, this was intolerable. “God does not play dice,” he protested. But experiments confirmed quantum statistics again and again. Probability was no longer ignorance—it was law.</p>
<p>The implications rippled beyond physics. Philosophers saw in uncertainty a metaphor for human limitation; theologians glimpsed freedom restored to a world once imprisoned by necessity. Causality survived, but as correlation within a statistical field, not as rigid chain.</p>
<p>Modern physics had not abandoned order; it had redefined it. Certainty gave way to structure, prediction to probability, and reality to relation. The age of determinism was over; the age of quantum understanding had begun.</p>
