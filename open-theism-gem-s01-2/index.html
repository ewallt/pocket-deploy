<h1>Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · God, Time, and Foreknowledge: The Central Question</p>
<article>
<p>The relationship between God, time, and foreknowledge lies at the heart of the Open Theism debate. Classical theological traditions generally affirm that God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge (EDF) of all future events. This means that every single event, every human choice, every outcome, is known by God with absolute certainty before it happens. This knowledge is often understood to be timeless, meaning God doesn't "foresee" in a temporal sense, but simply "sees" all of time, past, present, and future, simultaneously as an eternal present.</p>
<p>Open Theism directly challenges this classical understanding by asking: "Does God know *all* future choices exhaustively?" They contend that if the future truly contains free human choices, then those choices, by their very nature, are not yet definite. They exist as genuine possibilities. To say God knows a free choice with absolute certainty before it occurs would, in their view, strip that choice of its genuine freedom. If it's already a settled fact in God's mind, then the individual cannot truly choose otherwise, leading to a form of soft determinism.</p>
<p>The central question, therefore, revolves around the nature of future contingent events. Are future free choices truly contingent—meaning they could go either way—or are they merely appearing to be so from our limited human perspective? Open Theists argue for the former. They propose that the future is a mixture of settled realities (e.g., God's promises, physical laws) and unsettled possibilities (e.g., free choices). God knows the entire landscape of what is settled and what is possible, but He does not know as a settled fact which possibility a free agent will choose.</p>
<p>This raises profound questions about God's relationship to time. While classical theism often posits God as being outside of or beyond time (atemporal), many Open Theists suggest that God is everlasting, meaning He exists within time but has no beginning or end. An everlasting God experiences events sequentially, which allows for genuine response and interaction with creatures in a temporal flow. This temporal model of God's existence is more compatible with the idea of an open future, where God's knowledge grows as free creatures make their choices.</p>
<p>In essence, the debate is not about whether God is omniscient, but about what omniscience entails. For classical theists, omniscience means knowing all true propositions, including those about the future. For Open Theists, propositions about future free choices are not yet true or false; they are possibilities. Therefore, God's omniscience means He knows everything that is logically possible to know, and an unsettled future choice is not in that category. The core issue is whether the future is as fixed and knowable as the past, or if it remains partly open, waiting to be written by the choices of free beings in relationship with God.</p>
