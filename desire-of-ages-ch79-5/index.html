<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 5: Drawn Into Obedience — Life After “Finished”</h1><p class="intro">The finished work creates a people who obey from love—pathways open, power given, methods matched to the message.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Because the cross has told the truth and settled the case, the Spirit now draws rather than drives. Jesus promised that when He was lifted up He would draw all; the chapter applies this to life after Calvary. Access is open—signaled by the veil’s tearing—and invitation is honest: come without price because the price is paid. Communities formed here design pathways, not choke points, for every class of person to approach God in confidence.</p>
<p>Obedience, then, is not a fearful scramble to earn standing; it is the family resemblance of the reconciled. United to Christ, believers receive both a new verdict and a new vigor. The law that once condemned now describes the life they are learning to love. Mercy does not relax holiness; it makes holiness welcome. The same love that justified them now energizes their choices, and the same Spirit that sealed them now teaches their hands.</p>
<p>Practically, this looks ordinary and durable: promises kept when applause fades; restitution made when harm is faced; forgiveness offered without denial; hospitality extended without calculation. Methods matter. The people of a non-coercive King cannot advance His cause by pressure or manipulation. They persuade as they were persuaded—by truth, patience, fairness, and sacrificial kindness. The victory that saved them shapes the way they serve.</p>
<p>Assurance and urgency live together. “Finished” gives rest to anxious consciences and steel to hesitant wills. We work because the work that saves is done; we speak because the evidence is strong; we endure because the outcome is not in doubt. Hope becomes stubborn in suffering, generous in disagreement, and public in witness. The world learns our doctrine by our methods and our methods by our Master.</p>
<p>This life also knows how to end well. The chapter closes with the Saviour’s final entrustment—“Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit”—and invites disciples to practice the same trust in a hundred smaller endings. We keep Sabbath as resistance to despair and rehearsal for joy, resting in a salvation we did not achieve. We commend our hours, our work, and our dying to the Hands that raised Him.</p>
<p>Thus the arc completes: finished work → unveiled God → vindicated law → given righteousness → obedient love. The cross does not merely rescue persons; it secures a universe and forms a people whose lives make its meaning visible. That is life after “Finished.”</p>
