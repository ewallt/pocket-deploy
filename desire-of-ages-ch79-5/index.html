<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 5: “Into Your Hands”</h1><p class="intro">The final word is not despair but trust—life yielded to the Father who will give it back on the third day.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>After the cry of completion, Jesus speaks once more: “Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit.” The prayer returns to intimacy. The darkness has not silenced “Father,” nor has pain undone confidence. Death is not an escape but an offering—the Son handing Himself where He has always lived, inside the Father’s care. The government of love ends its earthly mission as it began: in trust.</p>
<p>He bows His head and gives up the ghost. The phrasing preserves agency; no one takes His life from Him. Surrender here is sovereign, not passive. Having finished the work, He chooses the moment to rest. Sabbath approaches, and creation’s first rhythm—work completed, rest blessed—reappears at redemption’s climax. The world is invited to exhale with its Lord.</p>
<p>For friends who watch, the word anchors grief. They lay Him in a new tomb not because hope has died, but because hope is keeping time. Promises once puzzling now glow—Jonah’s sign, the temple raised in three days, the grain that must fall. Faith is asked to do what it often must: wait in the dark with a sentence from God for company.</p>
<p>For us, “into Your hands” becomes a benediction over every ending we dread. We commend work we cannot control, children we cannot shield, bodies we cannot keep young. Trust does not deny sorrow; it denies sovereignty to fear. The hands that hold the Son will hold those given to the Son, through sleep and storm and the last breath we will take.</p>
<p>Communities shaped by this word will practice holy endings—confession before sundown, reconciliation before burial, liturgies that teach the living how to die well. They will keep Sabbath with purpose, not as escape from the world but as prophetic rest in a world that tries to earn what Christ has finished. Rest becomes resistance to despair and rehearsal for joy.</p>
<p>Thus the chapter closes with the quiet strongest of all. Love has told the truth, borne the weight, opened the way, shaken the earth, and finally rested. The dawn is scheduled. Until then, the church lives by this last lesson from the cross: to place everything and everyone into the Father’s hands—and sleep.</p>
