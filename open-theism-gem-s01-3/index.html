<h1>Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 3 · The Argument from Human Freedom: Does Determinism Conflict with Love?</p>
<article>
<p>A primary motivation for Open Theism is the preservation of what it considers genuine human freedom, often termed libertarian free will. This is the view that for a choice to be free, the agent must have the ability to choose more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances. Open Theists argue that if God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge (EDF) of all future human choices, then this kind of freedom is logically impossible. The argument, simply put, is that if God knows with certainty that a person will do X tomorrow, then it is not possible for that person to do not-X.</p>
<p>This leads to a form of theological determinism. While it's not causal determinism (where God directly causes the action), it is logical determinism: the future is fixed and unalterable because it is already known as a settled reality by God. From this perspective, human freedom becomes an illusion. We may feel free, but our choices are as fixed as the past. This raises significant theological problems, especially concerning moral responsibility. If a person cannot do otherwise, can they be held genuinely responsible for their actions? Open Theists would argue they cannot, which undermines concepts of judgment, reward, and punishment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Open Theists contend that this deterministic view compromises the nature of love. For love to be authentic, it must be freely given. If God created beings whose future choices—including their choice to love Him—were already known and settled, then that love is not a free gift but an inevitable outcome. The relationship between God and humanity would resemble a meticulously scripted play rather than a genuine, dynamic love story. For God to truly desire a relationship of love, He must create beings with the capacity to freely choose to love or not to love, which requires a future that is open to those possibilities.</p>
<p>This argument extends to the problem of evil. If God has exhaustive foreknowledge of every sinful act, then He created a world knowing with certainty every tragedy and atrocity that would occur. While classical theists argue that God permits evil for a greater good, Open Theists find this explanation troubling. They propose that God takes a genuine risk in creating free agents. He knows that evil is a possibility, but He does not know with certainty which evils will be actualized. This reframes God's relationship to evil: He does not merely permit it as part of a detailed eternal blueprint but rather actively works to overcome the evil that arises from the misuse of creaturely freedom.</p>
<p>In summary, the Open Theist argument from freedom posits that exhaustive divine foreknowledge is incompatible with libertarian free will. They believe that this incompatibility has damaging consequences for understanding moral responsibility, the authenticity of love, and the problem of evil. By proposing a future that is partly open, they believe they can uphold a more robust and biblically consistent account of a relational God who interacts with genuinely free creatures.</p>
