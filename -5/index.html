  <h1>Peace for the Universe</h1>
  <p class="intro">When truth is seen and love is trusted, the war that began in heaven has no fuel left to burn.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
  <p>The victory is not the silencing of opposition by superior force but the settling of questions so thoroughly that rebellion can never arise again. The cross has persuaded the loyal beings who watched it that God is entirely trustworthy. Their worship is not flattery but relief—relief that reality rests on goodness that cannot be shaken. This is the peace that endures because it is chosen with open eyes.</p>
  <p>Such peace invites a new understanding of allegiance. Obedience becomes the cooperation of friends, not the compliance of servants. Instruction is welcomed because it comes from One whose heart has been proved. Authority is no longer frightening when it is transparently benevolent and consistently self-giving.</p>
  <p>Here and now, doubts still linger on this planet, and freedom allows them to linger. Yet the same evidence stands for us as for the unfallen observers. We are asked to weigh it honestly: What has God shown of Himself? What do His choices under pressure reveal? Faith grows where these questions are faced without evasion.</p>
  <p>When trust is restored, community flourishes. Fear loosens its grip, coercion loses its appeal, and the fruits of the Spirit become the natural language of a healed people. The final judgment then is not a terrifying secret but an open confirmation that the truth has had its say and love has won its case.</p>
  <p>To live within that peace is to become an answer in the same controversy—to embody the confidence that God has worked so patiently to restore. Friendship with Him becomes the quiet testimony by which the universe stays free.</p>
