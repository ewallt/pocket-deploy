<section class="p">
<p>Many people have learned to fear God because religion has painted Him in terrifying colors. Graham Maxwell opens his book by asking whether we would enjoy meeting God face-to-face today. Our answer, he says, reveals what we believe about His character. If He is arbitrary or vindictive, fear is rational; but if He is exactly like Jesus, then trust is the only reasonable response.</p>
<p>Through Scripture, God has been misrepresented as cruel, vengeful, and unpredictable. Maxwell argues that these pictures reflect human projection rather than divine reality. The cross stands as God’s self-revelation, disproving Satan’s charges and showing that love alone governs the universe.</p>
<p>When Moses trembled at Sinai, God’s answer was not more thunder but gentle assurance: “I am with you.” Throughout history, He has tried to replace fear with faith by demonstrating His trustworthiness in relationship after relationship.</p>
<p>Fear remains because we don’t really know Him. Knowledge of God and trust in God grow together — and that knowledge comes through the life and death of Christ. The more clearly we see Jesus, the less we dread the Father.</p>
<p>The goal of the gospel is not to appease God but to heal our mistrust. When love casts out fear, we are ready to meet Him as friends.</p>
