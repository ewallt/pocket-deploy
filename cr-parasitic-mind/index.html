        "paragraphs": [
          {
            "heading": "Start Where Real Claims Live",
            "content": "Most claims don’t arrive in lab coats. They show up in a group chat, a podcast, a staff meeting, or over coffee—tight, emotional, and confident. You hear a sentence like, “This program is ruining outcomes,” and heads nod before anyone asks, “Outcomes of what, measured how, compared to what?” Treat the claim like a mysterious fever: the symptoms are loud, but the cause is unclear. Your first job is not to argue; it’s to name what, exactly, has been asserted. If you can’t write it down plainly, you can’t test it. Clarity lowers the temperature. People relax when a fuzzy complaint becomes a precise sentence with nouns and verbs. That’s step one in cognitive hygiene: turn noise into a clean, testable line of text."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Pathogen or Preference?",
            "content": "Some statements are about the world; others are about what we value. “Hybrid work reduces team productivity” is an empirical claim. “Hybrid work feels healthier” is a preference. Many hot takes are mixed: a value dressed in a fact’s clothing or vice versa. Write the sentence and tag it: FACT, VALUE, or MIXED. If it’s VALUE, you can still discuss trade-offs. If it’s FACT, it must, in principle, be disprovable. If it’s MIXED, split it in two: one line for the measurable part, one for the judgment. This simple tagging stops arguments that are really mismatched debates—morals on one side, metrics on the other. When you know which kind of animal you’re handling, you choose the right net."
          },
          {
            "heading": "From Hot Take to Hypothesis",
            "content": "A hot take becomes a hypothesis when it gains bones: population, exposure, outcome, comparator, and time. Use this sturdy template: “Among [population], [exposure] is associated with [outcome], compared to [comparator], over [time window].” For example: “Among first-year students at Campus X, mandatory laptops are associated with lower exam scores than paper-first classrooms over two semesters.” Now you have a claim you can actually check. Loose words like “harm,” “better,” and “ruins” are replaced by exam scores, cohorts, and dates. The template doesn’t remove passion; it channels it toward evidence. A sentence that fits the template can be tested, reproduced, and—if needed—retracted. That’s how you keep your mind clean."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Define What Counts as ‘Harm’ or ‘Benefit’",
            "content": "Vague nouns make strong opinions and weak tests. If the claim is about harm, decide what counts: lower scores, higher dropout, more incidents, slower recovery, reduced satisfaction. Pick one or two outcomes you can measure without guesswork. If the claim is about benefit, do the same. Choosing an outcome forces you to pair feelings with numbers. It also prevents later goalpost moves—switching from “scores” to “retention” after the data arrive. When you name the outcome, you are choosing the battlefield. Make it specific enough that a reasonable critic would agree the metric fits the promise made by the claim."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Pick a Comparator and Say It Out Loud",
            "content": "Every claim hides a question: compared to what? Compared to last year, to a similar group, to the rest of the country, to doing nothing at all? Choose a comparator that is fair, available, and easy to explain. Write it beside the claim. Bad comparisons—different populations, different calendars, cherry-picked baselines—create phantom effects that disappear under better light. Good comparisons turn arguments into experiments you can run with existing data. When you fix the comparator in advance, you keep yourself honest and save hours of post hoc rescue work."

          {
            "heading": "Scope the Population and Time Window",
            "content": "A claim without a boundary invites cherry-picking. Who is included, exactly? Which schools, clinics, cities, teams? Over what months or years? Give the claim a fence and a clock. If you discover an effect in a small pilot, don’t quietly treat it like a national truth. If the claim is national, don’t secretly evaluate it with one campus’s data. Boundaries don’t weaken your point; they strengthen it by making it clear where the claim lives and where it doesn’t. Later, you can test whether it generalizes. First, contain it."
          },

            "heading": "Pre-Register Your Gut",
            "content": "Before you look at numbers, write what you expect to see and what would change your mind. Two lines will do: “Prediction: …” and “Falsifier: …” This is not for show; it is for your future self, the one who will be tempted to reinterpret everything after seeing the results. Pre-registering your gut makes you braver and fairer. It also gives your collaborators confidence that you are not quietly bending the story. If the data surprise you, say so and update. That is not weakness; that is hygiene working as designed."

            "heading": "Operationalize the Variables",
            "content": "Turn the nouns into numbers you can actually observe. “Engagement” might be attendance rate, assignment completion, or active minutes in tool logs. “Safety” might be incident reports per 1,000 participants. Write the exact field names, sources, and how you’ll clean them. Decide in advance how you’ll handle missingness and outliers. This is where many claims die or are reborn: once the abstractions become fields in a spreadsheet, your test stops being imaginary. It becomes something another person could run tomorrow and get the same answer."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Draft the One-Sentence Test",
            "content": "Pull it all together into a single, accountable sentence: “We will compare [outcome] for [population] under [exposure] versus [comparator] over [time], using [data source], and we will consider the claim falsified if [threshold].” That sentence is your handshake with dissenters. They may dislike your threshold or propose a better comparator, but now you’re arguing constructively. The test sentence is clear enough that two honest opponents can run it and agree on what it says. That agreement is the whole point."
          },

            "heading": "Why Naming Matters",
            "content": "Naming the parasite—turning a fuzzy claim into a testable hypothesis—slows contagion. It makes the conversation safer to join. It also gives you the first page of your Idea Triage Journal: the cleaned claim, the tags (FACT/VALUE/MIXED), the comparator, the scope, the prediction, and the falsifier. The rest of the course builds on this page. If you can do Unit 1 well, the next steps—triage, base rates, causal maps, evidence ranking—become natural. Precision isn’t pedantry. It’s the air filter for your thinking."

Triage decides who gets immediate attention, who waits, and who is discharged with a kind word. Cognitive hygiene borrows the same habit. We will not chase every claim. We will rank them by clarity, stakes, and testability. A low-stakes, vague complaint can wait. A high-stakes, clear, testable claim comes to the front. Triage is not cynicism; it is stewardship of attention so you can do your best thinking where it matters most."

            "content": "The fastest way to make enemies and learn nothing is to knock down the weakest version of someone’s claim. Steel-manning forces you to restate the claim as its strongest, fairest self before you critique it. Ask the person who believes it, “If I wrote this sentence, would you sign it?” Keep polishing until they say yes. You are not giving up your view; you are earning the right to test theirs. Steel-manning lowers defenses, reveals hidden assumptions, and often turns an argument into a joint inquiry. People will listen to your data if you first listened to their meaning."

A—Alternatives (two rival explanations you’d consider). G—Ground truth (the best source you can access fast). E—Exposure (who is affected and how much). You can run this card in three minutes on a whiteboard or scribbled in a margin. It gives you a simple, shared language for deciding if the claim advances to deeper testing or goes to the waiting room."

            "heading": "Target and Restatement",
            "content": "Write the original sentence exactly as spoken, then write your steel-man beside it. Remove the heat words. Keep the promise words. If the original says, “This policy is wrecking kids,” your steel-man might read, “Among students in Grades 6–8 at Schools A–C, the new homework policy is associated with lower math scores than last year’s policy over two terms.” Send it back to the claimant. If they agree, you’ve built a bridge. If they don’t, keep refining. When both sides sign the restatement, you’ve achieved something rare: a shared target."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Indicators: What Would We Measure?",
            "content": "Indicators are your thermometers and pulse oximeters. Choose the smallest set that would truly reflect the promise of the claim. If the claim is about learning, test scores may be right—but perhaps homework completion or absenteeism tells the story better. Decide how often you’ll measure, how you’ll aggregate, and who will collect. Write the field names and sources. Indicators keep you honest when stories get sticky; they tether the debate to something you can point at without raising your voice."
          },

            "heading": "Alternatives: The Rival Explanations You Must Name",
            "content": "Every claim sits among plausible rivals. Maybe scores fell because of the new policy—or because of staffing changes, curriculum shifts, or a wave of illness. Name at least two alternatives up front. If you can’t name rivals, you’re not ready to test. When you admit alternatives early, critics become collaborators. They can help you design a test that distinguishes your favored explanation from the others. If your claim survives that test, it emerges stronger; if it fails, you update with grace."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Ground Truth: Where the Numbers Come From",
            "content": "Choose the best source you can reach quickly: the student information system, the HR database, the survey exports, the public dashboard. Note who maintains the data and how timely it is. If the only available source is a social feed or a blog with no data, mark the claim as low priority until better ground truth appears. Reality must be able to vote on the argument. If reality can’t vote, you’re not doing analysis; you’re not doing folklore."
          },

            "heading": "Exposure: Who Is Affected, and How Much?",
            "content": "Two claims can be equally clear but very different in urgency. Exposure answers, “If the claim is true, who is touched and how deeply?” A small effect on millions may deserve more attention than a large effect on dozens—and vice versa, depending on the stakes. Write the group size and the size of the supposed effect. When you do, triage becomes fair. You’re not chasing the loudest voice; you’re serving the biggest need."

            "heading": "Common Failure Modes",
            "content": "Watch for these: straw-manning (attacking a weaker cousin of the claim), motte-and-bailey (retreating to a safe, vague claim when pressed), moving baselines (switching comparators after the fact), and category slips (treating a value as a fact or a fact as a value). TRIAGE protects you from each failure: the quote preserves the target, the restatement fixes the scope, indicators anchor the baseline, and alternatives keep you from worshiping your first hunch. Use the card and you will argue less and learn more."

            "heading": "From Triage to Next Steps",
            "content": "When the card is filled, decide: advance, wait, or discharge. Advance means the claim is clear, testable, high-stakes, with indicators and rivals named; it moves to base-rate checks in Unit 3. Wait means you need a comparator, better data access, or a cleaner steel-man. Discharge means the claim is mostly preference or gossip; you can wish it well and save your energy. Capture the TRIAGE sheet in your Idea Triage Journal. The habit will feel slow at first. Then it will feel like breathing—automatic, and the thing that keeps you clear-headed when everyone else is shouting."

            "content": "Anecdotes travel faster than arithmetic. A single vivid case can convince a room that a trend is exploding or a policy is failing. Base rates pull you back to earth: how often does this thing happen in general, before we look at the special case? When you ask for the base rate, you are switching from the “inside view” (this story, this headline, this friend) to the “outside view” (the long-run frequency across many cases). Most apparent crises vanish under that light; some grow sharper and more urgent. The hygiene habit is simple: before you react, ask, “Out of how many? Over what time? Compared to what baseline?” Numbers won’t silence every argument, but they will shrink the space where panic lives and expand the space where planning can begin."
          },

            "heading": "The Denominator Drill",
            "content": "Memorize this quick sequence and you’ll catch half of all statistical mirages. 1) Count the numerator (events, incidents, wins, failures). 2) Name the denominator (people, units, days, miles). 3) Normalize: events per 1,000 people, per 10,000 flights, per 100,000 hours—whatever makes sense for scale. 4) Set a time window (week, month, year) and keep it consistent. 5) Write the comparator in plain words (“vs. last year,” “vs. similar schools,” “vs. national average”). If any piece is missing, do not draw a conclusion. The Drill sounds basic because it is. It works because our brains love numerators and forget denominators, especially under stress. Bring the denominator back and the picture stops wobbling."

            "heading": "Rates, Not Raw Counts",
            "content": "Raw counts reward the biggest group, the busiest intersection, the largest hospital. Rates correct that tilt. Ten incidents in a town of 5,000 are not the same as ten incidents in a city of 5,000,000. Report both counts and rates; the count tells you total load, the rate tells you risk. Choose a denominator that reflects exposure: per resident, per customer-hour, per lane-mile, per 1,000 visits. If you pick the wrong exposure (e.g., per capita when the real exposure is “nights spent downtown”), you will see patterns that aren’t there. Rates don’t make decisions for you, but they make fairness possible by letting unlike places be compared on level ground."
          },
          {
            "heading": "Absolute vs. Relative Risk—The Twin Traps",
            "content": "Relative changes make small things look huge; absolute changes make big things look small. “A 100% increase!” could mean 2 cases became 4. “Only a 1% change” could hide the fact that 10,000 people were affected. Always pair them: “The rate rose from 2 per 100,000 to 4 per 100,000 (a 100% increase; +2 per 100,000).” When you communicate both, panic and complacency lose their grip. People can hold two truths: something can double and still be rare; something can barely budge in percent terms and still hurt thousands. Hygiene is not about minimizing or maximizing; it is about seeing scale clearly enough to choose well."

          {
            "heading": "Time Windows and Seasonality",
            "content": "Most systems breathe. Retail surges in holidays, clinics in winter, campuses at term changes. If you compare March to December without acknowledging seasonality, you will “discover” cycles that simply reflect the calendar. Pick windows that respect the rhythm of the domain (pay periods, semesters, quarters), and compare like with like. Rolling averages smooth noise; year-over-year cuts show true drift. When you suspect seasonality, plot multiple years stacked on the same calendar axis and look for repeating waves. If the wave is real, don’t fight it—plan for it. Hygiene means choosing windows that honor the organism you’re measuring."

          {
            "heading": "Sampling Frames: Who Gets Counted?",
            "content": "Your denominator is only as honest as your sampling frame. If a survey reaches only the most online, you will measure the most online. If a complaint form is buried three clicks deep, you will measure the most persistent. Spell out how cases enter the dataset and who gets left at the door. Convenience samples can guide a pilot but shouldn’t anchor policy. If you can, draw a simple map of your pipeline: source → filter → dataset. Where the pipeline narrows, bias blooms. Name the choke points and either widen them or adjust your claims to match the data you truly have."

            "content": "When N is tiny, randomness masquerades as trend. A school of 120 will swing harder than a district of 12,000; a clinic with 8 ICU beds will show “spikes” that are just the arithmetic of small denominators. Put confidence bands around small groups or pool them until the rate stabilizes. If you must monitor a small N in real time, set wider alert thresholds and require persistence (e.g., three consecutive weeks above the band) before acting. The mind craves stories about every wiggle; the hygiene habit is to label these wiggles correctly: possibly signal, probably noise—check again next period."

            "heading": "Visuals That Encourage Honesty",
            "content": "Good charts make good behavior easy. Use paired panels: counts above, rates below. Use the same y-axis across peers to stop unintentional exaggeration. Add faint reference lines for the long-run mean and a band for one standard deviation; if a line pops out of the band, it’s worth a look. When comparing groups of different sizes, use dots with a funnel-shaped confidence band: small groups will vary more; the band warns you not to overreact. These simple design choices reduce the number of “gotcha” moments and help collaborators focus on the few places where reality truly changed."

Role-play a three-minute version: one person scopes, one anchors, one frames time and stakes, one calls the exit. Rotate roles. Practice on low-stakes topics so the protocol is familiar when the stakes rise. Your goal is muscle memory: in the heat of a real debate, your mouth remembers to scope the claim, your hand reaches for the anchor, and your calendar suggests the next check before tempers can."

Write the unedited sentence as you first heard it. Then, in one line, say why this claim deserves attention now. You are not hunting for a perfect topic; you are committing to a real one.

Tag it FACT, VALUE, or MIXED; if MIXED, split into two lines—one moral, one measurable. Write a falsifier: the simplest result that would change your mind. Pre-register your expectation in one sentence. These steps feel small because they are. They also do most of the work. A scoped, tagged, pre-registered claim cannot hide inside vibes.

Name at least two rival explanations you’re willing to consider. Identify the best accessible ground truth source and the refresh cadence. Estimate exposure: who would feel the effect and by how much if the claim is true? Take a photo of the card or paste it into your journal.

Write one sentence that anyone could read and understand: “We average 7.2 incidents per 10,000 visits; last year’s same quarter was 7.0; peer average is 6.8.” Baselines stop you from discovering fake shocks and give future you a yardstick that will not move when the story does."

Pre-register the analysis steps you will take first, and mark which explorations are allowed after. Name the smallest effect size that would change your decision.

What second-order effects could your announcement cause if you are wrong? Do one tiny experiment—recreate a chart, search a quoted line, peek at a method section—before you ship a confident message. Add a one-line note to your journal: the checks you ran and the verdict (share, share, shelve, or share with caveats). Hygiene leaves receipts."

End with a decision scaled to evidence: pilot, pause, or proceed. Pair the decision with the red lines that would trigger a change.
