<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 12 · Alternative Models: Arminianism, Molinism, and Calvinism</p>
<article>
<p>Open Theism is not the only model that seeks to explain the relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom. It exists in a spectrum of theological views, most notably Calvinism, Arminianism, and Molinism. Understanding these alternatives helps to place Open Theism in its proper context.</p>
<p><strong>Calvinism (or Reformed Theology):</strong>
- <em>Core Idea:</em> God's sovereignty is meticulous and absolute. God has, from eternity, decreed everything that will come to pass, including human salvation (predestination).
- <em>Foreknowledge:</em> God's foreknowledge is based on His decree. He knows what will happen because He has planned it.
- <em>Free Will:</em> Calvinists affirm a "compatibilist" view of freedom. Humans act according to their own desires and wills (they are not puppets), but their desires have been shaped by God so that they will ultimately choose what God has decreed. They are free in the sense that they are not coerced against their will, but they cannot choose contrary to God's sovereign plan.
- <em>Relation to Open Theism:</em> Calvinism is the strongest contrast to Open Theism, as it affirms a completely "closed" and determined future.</p>
<p><strong>Classical Arminianism:</strong>
- <em>Core Idea:</em> God desires all people to be saved and gives them "prevenient grace," which enables them to freely choose or reject Him.
- <em>Foreknowledge:</em> Arminianism strongly affirms God's exhaustive definite foreknowledge. God knows with absolute certainty what every person will freely choose to do.
- <em>Free Will:</em> Arminians hold to libertarian free will—the ability to choose between two or more live options. They argue that this freedom is genuine, but God is able to perfectly foresee how it will be exercised without determining it.
- <em>Relation to Open Theism:</em> Open Theism grew out of the Arminian tradition's emphasis on free will. Open Theists agree with Arminians on libertarian freedom but disagree that exhaustive foreknowledge is compatible with it. They see themselves as resolving a logical tension within Arminianism.</p>
<p><strong>Molinism:</strong>
- <em>Core Idea:</em> Molinism, named after the 16th-century Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, offers a complex synthesis to reconcile strong sovereignty and libertarian freedom.
- <em>Foreknowledge:</em> Molinism introduces the concept of God's "middle knowledge" (*scientia media*). This is God's knowledge of what any free creature *would* do in any possible circumstance. For example, God knows that if person P is put in circumstance C, P will freely choose A.
- <em>Sovereignty and Free Will:</em> Armed with this middle knowledge, God can sovereignly actualize a world in which He knows that, through their own free choices, creatures will bring about His desired ends. He controls the circumstances, and they freely choose within them.
- <em>Relation to Open Theism:</em> Molinism is a major alternative for those who want to affirm both libertarian freedom and exhaustive divine foreknowledge. Open Theists often criticize Molinism by questioning whether there are any "truths" about what creatures *would* freely do before God decides which world to create.</p>
<p>Each of these systems attempts to provide a coherent explanation for the biblical data. Open Theism's unique contribution is its willingness to reconsider the nature of the future and the definition of omniscience to fully preserve libertarian freedom and a dynamic, relational view of God.</p>
