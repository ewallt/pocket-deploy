<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 4: Christ Our Righteousness — Just and the Justifier</h1><p class="intro">What the law requires, Christ provides; on that basis God is just and the justifier of all who believe.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Put plainly: the law requires righteousness—a righteous life and a perfect character—and this we do not have to give. Christ provides both. His life of obedience is credited to the believer; His death satisfies the law’s claim against us. Justification is not a legal fiction but a truthful gift: we are counted righteous because we are united to the Righteous One. Assurance, then, rests not on our temperature but on His finished work.</p>
<p>To say “credited” is not to say “disconnected.” The gift arrives within a relationship the cross has made possible. We receive by faith what we cannot produce, and that faith itself is trust in a Person revealed under pressure to be perfectly trustworthy. The Spirit joins us to Christ so that His story becomes our status and His power becomes our practice. God does not pretend; He adopts, clothes, and indwells.</p>
<p>On this ground, Paul’s line shines: God is “just, and the justifier.” No corner is cut. Justice is satisfied at Calvary, so God may forgive without suspicion of favoritism. Mercy becomes not a loophole but a covenant promise. The believing sinner stands acquitted because the Substitute stood accused and did not fail. No other vision offers a holiness so honest or a welcome so wide.</p>
<p>From this fountain flows transformation. The same Christ who covers us begins to form us. Obedience becomes possible not by fear of punishment but by love answering love. The gospel does not pardon without empowering, and the law does not demand without delivering. The righteousness provided is both counted to us and worked in us as we remain in Him. The finished work births a continuing work.</p>
<p>Pastorally, this rescues from two ditches. Despair surrenders because we cannot meet the standard; presumption shrugs because grace will tidy up later. The cross refutes both. We receive a verdict we could never earn and a power we could never muster. In that double gift, humility and confidence finally meet. Our boast is Christ alone, and therefore our courage grows.</p>
<p>The invitation is therefore simple and strong: come to Christ as you are; remain with Christ as He is. In His righteousness you are safe; in His Spirit you are changed. The Father’s welcome rests on the Son’s merit, and the Spirit’s presence makes that welcome felt and fruitful.</p>
