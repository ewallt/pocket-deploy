<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 4: Earthquake and Awakening</h1><p class="intro">Creation shudders; hearts awaken. The ground speaks, and so do witnesses who did not plan to believe.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>When Jesus dies, the earth quakes and rocks split. Nature refuses to remain neutral at the murder of its Maker. The shock is not theatrics but testimony: the world knows its Lord. Tombs open and saints are raised, a preview of what the finished work intends for the whole creation. Judgment and hope meet in one tremor—structures crack while sleepers stir.</p>
<p>At the cross’s foot, a centurion watches courage without hatred, prayer without panic, love without self-protection. The earthquake is only half his evidence; the other half is the manner of the Man. His confession—“Truly this was the Son of God”—arrives from a mouth trained for orders, not creeds. Authority recognizes a higher Authority and bows. The gospel’s first Roman convert is a soldier on duty.</p>
<p>Women watch from a distance, witnesses the law would have discounted. They will anchor the coming morning with names and directions. For now, their presence rebukes the bravado that has fled and teaches the church to notice who stays when it costs. Awakening often begins at the margins while the center protects its story.</p>
<p>The religious establishment reads the same signs and hardens. Pilate grants the body; priests secure the tomb. Fear doubles down with strategies—seals, guards, rumors ready for purchase. The quake exposes more than geology; it exposes hearts. Finished work divides not by ethnicity or class but by response: surrender to what God has done, or schemes to manage it.</p>
<p>For disciples, the shaking clarifies foundations. Some confidences must crack—the need to control outcomes, the hope that goodness will go unopposed, the fantasy that we can follow without cost. What remains is firmer than stone: a crucified Love that does not flinch and a Father who raises the dead. On such ground we can stand when lesser footings slide.</p>
<p>Thus the chapter moves us from spectacle to stance. We do not chase quakes; we learn from them. We bear witness like the centurion, stay present like the women, and refuse the priestly reflex to contain what only God commands. The ground may move again; the hope will not.</p>
