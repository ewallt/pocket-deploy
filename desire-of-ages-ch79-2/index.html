<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 2: Unmasked — How God Wins</h1><p class="intro">The cross tears away Satan’s disguise and proves that God governs by truth, never by force.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The author insists that only at Christ’s death was Satan’s character fully unmasked. Up to Calvary he had retained sympathy even among holy beings by slandering God and disguising his own methods. The cross ends that slippage. When perfect goodness is hated, mocked, and murdered, there remains no doubt about the adversary’s spirit. The sympathy breaks, and the controversy swings on a hinge: the universe now has evidence that cannot be undone. What argument clouded, revelation clarifies.</p>
<p>Equally crucial is the method by which God arrives at this clarity. “Compelling power is found only under Satan’s government,” the chapter teaches; God refuses it. Rather than crush opposition, He allows time for principles to ripen so that the contrast can be seen. Patience is not indifference; it is love trusting light. The crucifixion, then, is not a last-minute resort but the long-prepared arena where truth and falsehood stand side by side until sight is plain.</p>
<p>This has pastoral consequence. Faith is not a leap into darkness; it is assent to the best-revealed reality in the cosmos. The cross presents a God who would rather suffer than coerce, who wins loyalty by disclosure, who keeps fairness even when power is possible. Worship after such unveiling is no longer fear management; it is glad confidence. Evangelism becomes invitation to look, not intimidation to submit. When the mask is gone, the heart finds permission to trust.</p>
<p>It also redefines victory. Triumph is not annihilation of enemies but exposure of enmity and endurance of love without becoming its opposite. Jesus disarms the ruler of this world by refusing his tools—accusation, manipulation, threat. The weapons of the kingdom are light and patience, holiness and mercy. The victory parade will be empty of trophies seized by force and filled with witnesses convinced by truth. That is why the cry “Finished” means future stability, not merely present rescue.</p>
<p>So the set’s second step is to honor the chapter’s emphasis on revelation as judgment. The world is judged when the lie about God dies before the sight of Jesus crucified. From that moment, every conscience has somewhere clear to look. Satan has not merely lost ground; he has lost credibility. And once a tyrant’s moral claim collapses, his time is short. The cross has started that clock.</p>
<p>To live under this banner is to abandon coercive shortcuts in our own work. We make room for questions, give evidence, tell the truth without pressure, and let trust grow at the speed of love. That is how God wins, and how His people do.</p>
