<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 2: Completion Announced</h1><p class="intro">With a loud voice, Jesus declares not surrender to defeat but the triumph of faithful love completing its work.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The cry changes key. After tasting the sour wine, He gathers strength and shouts, “It is finished.” Not <em>I am finished</em>, but <em>it</em>—the mission, the promised revelation, the obedience that answers Adam’s no with the Son’s yes. Heaven’s plan reaches its appointed hour, and history receives a cornerstone that will not crack. The word is victory, not resignation; consummation, not collapse.</p>
<p>What is finished? The exposure of the Adversary’s lies; the unveiling of the Father’s heart; the confirmation that God rules by truth and freedom, not by fear. The sacrificial system’s shadow has met its Substance. Prophecies braided through centuries pull taut—Son of David, Servant of the Lord, Lamb of God. The covenant is kept from God’s side without remainder, so sinners may run without bargaining into a love that has already paid the cost.</p>
<p>Finishing does not erase wounds; it transfigures them. The scars will remain as evidence that the victory did not bypass pain or enemies but passed through both without becoming them. Disciples tempted to equate success with ease must learn their grammar here. Triumph is fidelity kept under pressure, holiness refusing shortcuts when they glitter most, mercy holding steady even as mockers shout.</p>
<p>The shout also frees conscience. If the work that reconciles is complete in Christ, then our repentance is response, not purchase; our obedience is gratitude, not leverage. We do not add to the finished work; we join its wake—baptized into His death and raised into His life. Assurance stops being bravado and starts being trust in a Saviour who has really done what He said.</p>
<p>Communities shaped by this word become finishers too—not of redemption, but of the good they begin. They keep promises when applause fades; they make amends when harm is revealed; they persist in small mercies that look unremarkable until a lifetime names them holy. “It is finished” trains us to aim for faithfulness over drama and endurance over flashes.</p>
<p>The hour is almost over. One more word remains, and a sign or two that will ripple through temple and soil. But the center has been spoken. The One who entered our night has turned it by declaration into a dawn that cannot be held back. In that light, the world will breathe again.</p>
