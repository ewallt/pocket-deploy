<section class="p">
<p>In the Western script, the sheriff must shoot first to stop evil from striking again. He steals a march, tells a “necessary” lie, breaks a promise to bait the trap. When the dust settles, the town is safe and the badge still shines. The story insists the law occasionally needs a lawbreaker in its service.</p>
<p>This creed migrated from screens into pulpits. Many came to imagine that God maintains order the same way—that He must violate His own gentleness to defend goodness. The cross is then misread as divine retribution, a white hat reaching for black-hat tools to preserve the peace.</p>
<p>But Jesus refuses the bargain. He saves the law by keeping it. His truthfulness under pressure, His refusal to retaliate, and His self-giving love reveal that faithfulness itself is the power that changes the world. The kingdom never cheats to win; it witnesses to win.</p>
<p>Once we see this, the trope’s glamour fades. To excuse wrong for a right cause is to become what we oppose. Justice cannot survive if it imitates injustice, and truth cannot convince if it borrows the voice of deceit. Means make the message legible—or they erase it.</p>
<p>Discipleship therefore includes method. We do not merely aim at good outcomes; we practice good ways. In conflicts, ministries, and politics, we test tactics by this question: do they look like the King? If not, the hat color is a costume, not a character.</p>
<p>The law needs no lawbreakers. It needs people whose loyalty to love makes shortcuts impossible—and whose patience makes victories durable.</p>
