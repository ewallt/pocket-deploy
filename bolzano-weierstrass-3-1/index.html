<header class="h"><h1>Completeness Axiom</h1><p class="intro">LUB property, why ℝ isn't ℚ, and the foundation BWT rests on.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The real numbers ℝ are complete, meaning they possess the Least Upper Bound Property (LUB): every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in ℝ. This axiom distinguishes ℝ from ℚ. In the rationals, the set {x ∈ ℚ : x² < 2} is bounded above but has no rational supremum—√2 doesn't exist in ℚ. The reals fill these gaps. Completeness ensures that limits, suprema, and accumulation points that "should" exist actually do exist within ℝ. It is the bedrock on which analysis builds, and BWT is a direct consequence of this completeness.</p>
<p>Completeness is equivalent to several other properties: the Nested Interval Property (every nested sequence of closed intervals has nonempty intersection), the Monotone Convergence Theorem (every bounded monotone sequence converges), and the Cauchy Completeness (every Cauchy sequence converges). These are all facets of the same underlying truth: ℝ has no holes. Sequences that ought to converge do converge. Sets that ought to have suprema do have them. This coherence makes analysis work—limits behave predictably, and existence proofs succeed because missing points have been filled in.</p>
<p>BWT depends crucially on completeness. The proof via bisection uses the Nested Interval Property: shrinking closed intervals must intersect at a point. Without completeness, intervals might converge to a "gap" not in the space. In ℚ, the bisection argument for finding √2 produces nested intervals whose intersection is empty in ℚ. Similarly, a bounded sequence in ℚ might cluster toward an irrational, yielding no convergent subsequence within ℚ. BWT holds in ℝ precisely because ℝ is complete—accumulation points can't escape the space. Completeness is the invisible scaffolding supporting BWT's guarantee.</p>
<p>The LUB property also underlies the concept of lim sup and lim inf. For a bounded sequence, the set of subsequential limits is nonempty and bounded, hence has a supremum (lim sup) and infimum (lim inf). BWT can be rephrased: every bounded sequence has at least one subsequential limit, namely lim sup or lim inf. These limits exist because of the LUB property applied to the set of limit points. Thus BWT and completeness are tightly linked—BWT is a sequential expression of the fact that ℝ accommodates all limits that boundedness permits.</p>
<p>Constructing ℝ from ℚ formalizes completeness. Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences of rationals both yield a complete ordered field. The construction explicitly adds the missing suprema—cuts fill gaps by defining each real as the set of rationals below it; Cauchy completion adds limits of rational sequences. These constructions show completeness isn't a vague intuition but a precise property achieved by systematic extension. Once ℝ is complete, theorems like BWT follow inevitably. Without this construction, we'd be stuck in ℚ where boundedness doesn't guarantee accumulation within the space.</p>
<p>In summary, completeness is the axiom that makes ℝ analytically robust. It plugs the gaps in ℚ, ensures limits exist when they should, and enables theorems like BWT. The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem is not just a fact about sequences but a manifestation of ℝ's completeness. Understanding BWT requires appreciating completeness as the foundational property that allows bounded infinite processes to have convergent subsequences. Without completeness, BWT would fail; with it, boundedness becomes a guarantee of accumulation.</p>
