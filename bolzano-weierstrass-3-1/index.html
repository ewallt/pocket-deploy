      <p class="lead">Part 1 · Completeness Axiom</p>

      <article>
        <p>The completeness axiom proclaims that every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in ℝ. This property distinguishes the real line from the rational line. In ℚ, the set of rationals whose squares are less than 2 is bounded above but lacks a rational supremum. Introducing √2 forces us to extend the number system to ℝ, where the least upper bound exists. Completeness therefore explains why Bolzano–Weierstrass holds in ℝ but fails in ℚ.</p>

        <p>Completeness appears in several equivalent guises: every Cauchy sequence converges, every decreasing sequence bounded below converges, and every nested sequence of closed intervals with shrinking lengths intersects. These formulations create bridges between order, metric, and topological viewpoints. When we invoke Bolzano–Weierstrass, we implicitly rely on completeness to ensure that the limit point constructed by nested intervals actually belongs to ℝ.</p>

        <p>The axiom has historical roots in the work of Dedekind, Cantor, and Weierstrass. Dedekind introduced cuts; Cantor approached completeness via Cauchy sequences; Weierstrass emphasized limits defined by epsilons. Each perspective motivated different constructions of ℝ but converged on the same requirement: there can be no “holes.” The guarantee of suprema for bounded sets ensures the real line is gapless, enabling limit processes to succeed without leaving the space.</p>

        <p>Completeness also underpins measure theory, differential equations, and functional analysis. For instance, existence theorems for solutions often depend on completeness to extract convergent subsequences from bounded families of approximations. Without the axiom, iterative methods might approach phantom limits that fall outside the number system, undermining proofs that rely on compactness or continuity.</p>

        <p>In classroom practice, completeness surfaces whenever we justify that a monotone bounded sequence converges, or when we assert that an infinite decimal expansion defines a real number. The axiom legitimizes these intuitive steps. It also clarifies why Bolzano–Weierstrass is not a mere combinatorial coincidence but a deep reflection of ℝ’s structural richness.</p>

        <p>With completeness in hand, we next explore the Heine–Borel theorem, which translates the least upper bound property into geometric language: closed and bounded intervals behave compactly. That result tightens the link between sequential behavior and covering arguments, preparing the ground for the broader machinery of compactness.</p>
