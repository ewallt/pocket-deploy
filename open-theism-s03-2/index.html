<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · Alternative Models: Comparing with Arminianism, Molinism, and Calvinism</p>
<article>
<p>Classical Arminianism shares significant common ground with Open Theism regarding human freedom and divine love. Arminianism emerged from Jacobus Arminius's rejection of Calvinist double predestination, affirming that salvation depends on free human response to gracious divine initiative. God genuinely desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4), not merely the elect. Prevenient grace enables fallen humans to respond freely to the gospel. Believers can resist grace and fall away from salvation. These emphases on libertarian freedom and universal divine love align with Open Theist concerns. The crucial difference is that classical Arminians affirm exhaustive divine foreknowledge—God knows infallibly who will believe and who will reject grace, even though those choices are genuinely free and not divinely determined. Open theists see this combination as internally inconsistent.</p>

<p>The Arminian position attempts to affirm both libertarian freedom and comprehensive foreknowledge by insisting that foreknowledge does not cause the foreseen events. God knows what free creatures will choose without determining those choices. The knowledge is caused by the future free choices, not vice versa. Open theists argue this doesn't resolve the tension. If God knows with certainty that Jones will choose coffee tomorrow, then Jones cannot do otherwise tomorrow—doing otherwise would make God's knowledge false, which is impossible. Even if God's knowledge doesn't cause Jones's choice, the necessity of preserving divine infallibility means Jones's choice is effectively fixed. Arminians respond that the fixity is different from determination—Jones's choice remains genuinely free even if God's knowledge cannot be mistaken. Open theists remain unconvinced that this distinction succeeds.</p>

<p>Molinism, developed by Luis de Molina in the sixteenth century, proposes a sophisticated middle ground. God possesses three logical moments of knowledge: natural knowledge of all possibilities, middle knowledge of what free creatures would choose in any circumstance, and free knowledge of what will actually occur given God's creative decision. Middle knowledge—knowing all counterfactuals of creaturely freedom—allows God to guarantee outcomes without determining choices. By creating the world where circumstances elicit the desired free responses, God exercises comprehensive providence while respecting libertarian freedom. If God knows that in circumstance C, Jones would freely choose coffee, God can actualize C to ensure Jones's free coffee choice. This preserves both exhaustive foreknowledge and libertarian freedom, Molinists argue.</p>

<p>Open theists raise several objections to Molinism. First, the grounding objection questions what makes counterfactuals of freedom true. If Jones never faces circumstance C, what grounds the truth that Jones would freely choose coffee in C? It cannot be Jones's actual choice (since C never occurs), nor God's decree (that would eliminate freedom), nor anything else identifiable. The counterfactuals seem to float metaphysically ungrounded. Second, even if middle knowledge is possible, it seems to require that future free choices are in some sense already determinate—otherwise there's nothing for God to know. This reintroduces the very problem Molinism aimed to solve. Molinists defend the coherence of their position through detailed philosophical arguments, but open theists remain skeptical that middle knowledge successfully navigates between freedom and foreknowledge.</p>

<p>Calvinism represents the opposite pole from Open Theism on divine sovereignty and human freedom. Reformed theology affirms that God foreordains all events, including human choices, through eternal comprehensive decree. Nothing occurs by chance or creaturely autonomy; all unfolds according to God's sovereign will. Human choices are free in a compatibilist sense—persons act according to their desires without external compulsion—but those desires are themselves divinely determined. God's glory is maximized through meticulous sovereignty. The five points of Calvinism (total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints) flow from this foundational commitment to comprehensive divine control. Calvinists see Open Theism as compromising God's sovereignty so severely that it borders on heresy.</p>

<p>Open theists and Calvinists agree on little regarding divine providence and human agency. However, both take seriously God's comprehensive purposes and ultimate victory, unlike process theology which limits divine power fundamentally. The disagreement concerns how God's sovereignty operates—through meticulous determination of all details or through wise governance of genuinely free processes. Calvinists emphasize biblical texts affirming divine foreordination and control. Open theists emphasize texts depicting divine responsiveness and human responsibility. Each side accuses the other of ignoring contrary biblical evidence. Calvinists charge Open Theism with Pelagianism and making salvation depend on human autonomy. Open theists charge Calvinism with making God the author of sin and human beings mere robots acting out scripts. The gulf between these positions is profound.</p>

<p>Process theology deserves mention as sometimes confused with Open Theism despite significant differences. Process thought, stemming from Alfred North Whitehead, radically reimagines God as temporal, relational, and limited in both power and knowledge. God cannot coerce or control; divine influence operates purely persuasively. God did not create the world ex nihilo but has always related to an eternal multiplicity of actual entities. God experiences temporal succession and does not foreknow the future because it is genuinely open. Open Theism agrees with process theology on limited foreknowledge and divine temporality but rejects the limitation on divine power. Open theists affirm creation ex nihilo, divine omnipotence, the possibility of miracles, and traditional Christology—all denied or radically reinterpreted in process theology. Open Theism positions itself as a via media between classical theism and process theology, though critics on both sides question whether this middle position is coherent or collapses toward one pole or the other. The comparison highlights that Open Theism is not the most radical departure from classical theism imaginable, even if it represents a significant revision.</p>
