<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 1: Finished Work, Cosmic Scope</h1><p class="intro">Christ does not yield His life until the mission is complete; the cry announces victory heard across the universe.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>John’s spare line—“He said, It is finished”—carries more weight than any lament. It is not resignation; it is consummation. Heaven’s plan reaches its appointed hour; the Son has revealed the Father without remainder; the obedience promised where Adam failed stands tested and true. Angels who watched in silence now understand; unfallen worlds, long patient, see why history was allowed to run to this place. The word is public, loud, and royal. He chooses the moment, lays down His life, and signals that nothing required for saving sinners and securing the universe has been left undone.</p>
<p>“Finished” gathers promises and prophecies into a single cord. The Servant’s song, the Lamb’s shadow, the Son of David’s hope, the Seed that crushes the serpent—each thread now knots at Calvary. The long controversy has its answer not in argument but in evidence: a life without sin from wilderness to cross; a love that keeps truth under maximal pressure; a government that remains itself when provoked. No decree could have proved what the cross displays. The assurance it gives is not a mood; it is a verdict grounded in public fact.</p>
<p>The cry therefore frees conscience. We are not invited to finish what Christ left partial; we are summoned to trust what Christ finished perfectly. Repentance becomes response, not purchase; obedience becomes gratitude, not leverage. Faith stops negotiating and starts resting in what cannot be added to or improved. The immensity of the word—heard by men below and beings above—gives ordinary people a place to stand that fear cannot shake. The foundation under every later promise is this completed work.</p>
<p>At the same time, “finished” is not the end of God’s action; it is the secure beginning of ours. Because the work that reconciles is complete, the Spirit will be poured out; the nations will be drawn; the church will be formed as a living witness to what that word accomplished. Mission after Calvary is not speculation about God’s heart; it is distribution of what the cross has already declared. The sound that left Christ’s lips becomes the music that carries ours.</p>
<p>Importantly, the victor’s method matches the victory’s meaning. He finishes without coercion, spectacle, or retaliation. He refuses anesthetic that would blur consent; He declines displays that would win by awe instead of truth. The finished work therefore includes the way it was finished—patience under insult, mercy under theft, trust under eclipse. The means are part of the message, guaranteeing that what we are saved by is the same as what we are saved into.</p>
<p>From that cry flow key truths: the deceiver is unmasked; God wins without compulsion; law, justice, and mercy harmonize; righteousness is supplied in Christ; obedience is energized by love. The cross stands not only as rescue for persons but as the securement of a universe that will be safe forever.</p>
