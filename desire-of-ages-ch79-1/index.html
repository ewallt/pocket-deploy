<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 1: The Darkness and the Cry</h1><p class="intro">From the sixth hour to the ninth, light withdraws; a loud question reveals the cost and the character of God.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Noon becomes night. The evangelists describe a darkness over the whole land, a silence that is more than weather. The scene answers earlier scoffs for spectacle with a sign no one ordered: creation itself shrouds the Sufferer. In that veil, Jesus endures the awful loneliness He had foreseen in Gethsemane—the weight of sin and the felt absence of the Father. Holiness consents to stand where sinners stand so sinners may one day stand where holiness lives.</p>
<p>Then the cry: “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” Quoted from Psalm 22, it is lament, not unbelief. He clings to “My God” while naming abandonment’s chill. The words certify that salvation does not skip human anguish; it carries it. By praying Scripture in extremis, Jesus dignifies our darkest prayers and teaches us that faith can question without letting go. The question itself becomes witness: God is so unlike idols that He will bear even the feeling of Godforsakenness for us.</p>
<p>Misreadings multiply. Some think He calls Elijah; others fetch sour wine. But the chapter urges us to listen beyond the confusion. The Saviour is not performing despair; He is revealing love under eclipse—choosing trust when comfort is gone, choosing us when relief is within His power. The darkness cannot define the Light; it frames it. Out of that frame will come the word of completion that turns this question into confidence.</p>
<p>The church must learn to wait these hours without panic. Some seasons will feel unlit; some prayers will taste of metal. We answer them with Jesus’ own practice: honest lament anchored in covenant, Scripture spoken when sensation misleads, endurance without cruelty. Communities formed by this cry will not shame the sorrowful or rush to fix mysteries only God can hold; they will stay and pray the psalms till dawn.</p>
<p>At Calvary, the cry also unmasks the Enemy’s slander. If Satan’s reign leaned on lies about God’s hardness, here is a refutation that cannot be argued away. The Son bears the consequence of our rebellion and the fog our sins threw over heaven’s face, yet He believes enough to address the Hidden One as His. That sight judges the darkness and begins to lift it for the listening heart.</p>
<p>When the ninth hour comes, the question will yield to a declaration. But first we linger with the sound that proves our High Priest knows the worst of human midnights from the inside. In His voice we are not alone. The God who seems silent is the God who suffers, and the night is not the end.</p>
