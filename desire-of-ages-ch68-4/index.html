<header class="h"><h1>The Greeks Desire to See Jesus — Part 4: The Father’s Voice, The World’s Judgment</h1><p class="intro">Heaven answers the Son; the crowd debates; Jesus names a verdict that unmasks the ruler of this world.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>“Father, glorify Thy name.” The prayer lands like a key in a lock, and the door opens: a voice answers, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” The affirmation is for the listeners, Jesus says, not for Him. Still, we glimpse communion at work—mutual purpose, mutual delight. Glory will look like cross before it looks like crown, and heaven is unembarrassed to say so out loud.</p>
<p>The crowd’s reaction is diagnostic. Some hear thunder; others, an angel. Revelation always exposes our tunings. If we expect spectacle, we will name it weather; if we expect bureaucracy, we will assign a messenger. Only trust discerns the Father. The moment warns us that proximity to holy things does not guarantee recognition; humility does.</p>
<p>Then the line that shakes empires: “Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.” Judgment here is not merely sentencing; it is truth unveiled. The cross will display evil’s methods—accusation, coercion, envy—beside God’s, and the contrast will strip the tyrant of moral credibility. Power survives exposure by force; lies do not. The casting out begins where deception ends.</p>
<p>This verdict is liberating. If the ruler’s authority rested on fear and slander about God, then the revelation of the Son resets reality for all who believe. Consciences stand up straighter; prayers find a truer address; communities practice methods that match their message. The judge is the one who will be judged for us, and that changes how justice feels: severe toward harm, safe for sinners.</p>
<p>Practically, listening for the Father’s voice means measuring guidance by Jesus-shaped goals: truth without cruelty, courage without theatrics, mercy without manipulation. We test impressions by the cross’s grammar. Does this path make room for repentance? Does it protect the small? Does it honor God’s name rather than mine? Voices that fail the test go back to silence.</p>
<p>The Greeks asked to see. The Father answers by letting them hear—a pledge that what follows is not accident. When thunder confuses and angels feel distant, the Son remains clear. Keep company with His prayer, and the world’s verdict will not own you. The ruler is losing his mask; walk in the light that remains.</p>
