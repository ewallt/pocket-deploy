  <h1>What Sin Actually Does</h1>
  <p class="intro">The warning was never a threat of execution. Sin carries its ruin within itself.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
  <p>If distrust separates the soul from the only source of life, then the end of sin is not a punishment externally applied but a result internally inevitable. The earliest warning, “you will surely die,” was a statement of consequence, not an ultimatum backed by force. To read it otherwise is to credit the accusation that divine government is sustained by arbitrary terror.</p>
  <p>The cross clarifies this distinction. The Father does not strike the Son; He “gives Him up,” allowing the tide of human and demonic malice to run its course. In that relinquishing we see how God relates to freedom—even when freedom is used against Him. He does not sustain life by coercion, nor does He defend Himself by destroying those who doubt.</p>
  <p>The persistence of religious cruelty through history illustrates what lies about God will do in human hands. When people worship a deity imagined as a torturer, they become capable of torture in His name. Thus the most devout can become the most dangerous when fear replaces trust and power masquerades as holiness. The remedy is not stronger rules but a clearer view of God.</p>
  <p>Understanding sin as self-destruction reframes judgment. Judgment is not an arbitrary sentence but the sober disclosure of reality: what we have chosen and what that choice inherently brings. In refusing the Healer, the patient declines the only cure; the disease proceeds to its end. Divine tears accompany the outcome, for love grieves even when it consents to freedom.</p>
  <p>When consequence is seen in this light, repentance becomes intelligible and hopeful. We turn not to appease wrath but to return to trust, receiving life as a gift rather than grasping for safety by fear. The gospel is not about surviving a dangerous God; it is about learning to rejoice in a trustworthy One.</p>
