      <h1>Series 2 — Bolzano–Weierstrass</h1>
      <p class="lead">Part 2 · Neighborhoods &amp; Epsilon-Balls</p>

      <article>
        <p>Before we can navigate the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem, we must learn the grammar of neighborhoods. At a point \(a\), the most familiar neighborhood is an open interval \((a - \varepsilon, a + \varepsilon)\), capturing all real numbers within a distance \(\varepsilon\). This epsilon-ball encodes the intuitive statement “stay close to \(a\)” but makes it precise enough for proofs. By varying \(\varepsilon\), we generate a hierarchy of closeness that analysis relies on to define limits, continuity, and convergence.</p>

        <p>Neighborhoods come in several flavors. Deleted neighborhoods, for example, remove the point \(a\) itself, producing \(0 < |x - a| < \varepsilon\). They allow us to discuss the behavior of a function near a point without referencing the value at the point. Half-open intervals and rays represent directional neighborhoods, essential when limits differ depending on the approach from above or below. Each variation still shares the same heart: distances measured by absolute value.</p>

        <p>The epsilon machinery intertwines with quantifiers. Saying that \(x_n\) converges to \(L\) means that for every \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exists an index \(N\) such that whenever \(n \geq N\), the term \(x_n\) lives inside the \(\varepsilon\)-ball around \(L\). This “for every” followed by “there exists” pattern enforces discipline. Rather than eyeballing a graph, we must exhibit how large \(N\) needs to be, or at least show that such an \(N\) exists. Neighborhoods allow us to translate qualitative tendencies into quantifiable bounds.</p>

        <p>In the context of sequences, neighborhoods highlight why boundedness is a meaningful precondition. A bounded sequence fits entirely inside some fixed ball around the origin, meaning there is an \(M\) with \(|x_n| \leq M\) for all \(n\). Without this global neighborhood, even the epsilon language cannot pin down convergence because the sequence might wander off to infinity. Neighborhoods therefore serve dual roles: local control near a candidate limit and global control via bounding balls.</p>

        <p>Epsilon-balls also underpin the language of open sets. Any open subset of ℝ can be described as a union of such balls, making them fundamental building blocks for topology. This perspective becomes vital later when we reinterpret Bolzano–Weierstrass as a statement about compactness: every sequence in a compact set has a convergent subsequence whose limit remains inside the set. Compact sets, in turn, can be described via finite subcovers of open balls, tying the theorem back to neighborhood language.</p>

        <p>Keeping neighborhoods at the forefront prepares us for the rest of the series. Next we examine bounded sequences directly, cataloging examples that either settle down or refuse to do so. Along the way, epsilon-balls act as our measuring tape, letting us articulate exactly how close or how confined a sequence truly is.</p>
