<section class="p">
<p>When Jesus is tempted, the offer is a Western shortcut: all the kingdoms now, without the cross. He declines. When the mob arrives in Gethsemane, He heals the man His disciple wounds. On trial, He refuses performance. At Golgotha, He prays for enemies. Every scene denies the black-hat script.</p>
<p>His victory is not that He out-fought evil but that He out-loved it. Resurrection vindicates a life lived without coercion or deceit. The government on His shoulders is safe because the hands are pierced; power that would rather suffer loss than inflict it cannot be corrupted.</p>
<p>This is more than piety; it is the blueprint of reality. If God rules this way, then only these methods align with how the universe works. Truth creates; lies unravel. Mercy heals; hatred corrodes. The cross is not a divine exception—it is the revelation of the eternal rule.</p>
<p>To call Jesus Lord is to trust His way as well as His goal. We do not defend Him by switching hats. We follow Him into a victory that looks like patience, honesty, generosity, and joy—strength exercised as service.</p>
<p>In that light, the “hero” we grew up cheering begins to look small. The True Hero makes peace without becoming the thing He opposes, and that is the only peace that lasts.</p>
