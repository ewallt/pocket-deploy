      <article>
        <p>Sequential compactness is a natural generalization of Bolzano–Weierstrass. A metric space \(X\) is sequentially compact if every sequence in \(X\) has a convergent subsequence whose limit lies in \(X\). In \(\mathbb{R}\), the theorem tells us exactly which subsets enjoy this property: the closed and bounded ones. But in arbitrary metric spaces, sequential compactness becomes a stand-alone definition that captures the behavior we expect from compact sets in analysis.</p>

        <p>The equivalence between compactness and sequential compactness in metric spaces is a highlight of elementary topology. One direction is straightforward: compactness implies sequential compactness. Given a sequence \((x_n)\) in a compact space \(X\), consider the collection of closed sets formed by tails of the sequence. Using the finite intersection property or open covers built from neighborhoods around cluster points, we can extract a convergent subsequence. The reverse direction relies on building sequences that contradict the finite subcover condition when sequential compactness fails.</p>

        <p>Why does sequential compactness matter? Many analytical arguments focus on sequences rather than arbitrary open covers. For example, to show a continuous function achieves its maximum on a set, it suffices to show every maximizing sequence has a convergent subsequence whose limit still lies in the domain. Sequential compactness gives us exactly that control. It is often easier to manipulate sequences than to juggle open covers, making the sequential viewpoint particularly useful in functional analysis and PDE theory.</p>

        <p>Sequential compactness also interacts nicely with completeness. In metric spaces, sequential compactness implies total boundedness and completeness—two properties that together characterize compactness via the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem and related results. Thus Bolzano–Weierstrass’s guarantee about bounded sequences in \(\mathbb{R}\) becomes a blueprint for understanding the geometry of function spaces, probability measures, and solution sets of differential equations.</p>

        <p>As we push beyond \(\mathbb{R}\), it is important to remember the limitations. Sequential compactness is strictly weaker than compactness in general topological spaces; there exist sequentially compact spaces that are not compact and vice versa. However, in the metric contexts most analysts inhabit, the two notions coincide, allowing us to wield Bolzano–Weierstrass intuition with confidence.</p>

        <p>With sequential compactness in hand, we can turn to concrete consequences: continuous functions on compact sets attain extrema and behave uniformly. The next article explores these classic theorems and shows how Bolzano–Weierstrass underwrites them.</p>
