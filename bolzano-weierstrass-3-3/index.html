      <article>
        <p>Sequential compactness asserts that every sequence in a space has a convergent subsequence whose limit remains in the space. In ℝ, Bolzano–Weierstrass provides this property for closed and bounded sets. Extending the idea to metric spaces reveals a hierarchy of compactness notions—sequential compactness, countable compactness, and the open-cover definition—that coincide in metric settings but diverge elsewhere.</p>

        <p>In a metric space, sequential compactness implies compactness. Suppose a space were sequentially compact but not compact; then an open cover with no finite subcover would allow us to build a sequence lacking a convergent subsequence by hopping between uncovered regions, contradicting sequential compactness. Conversely, compact metric spaces are sequentially compact because any sequence either accumulates inside a finite subcover or produces a nested sequence of closed balls shrinking to a point.</p>

        <p>Sequential compactness provides a user-friendly toolkit. Analysts often prefer sequences over open covers because subsequences align with familiar limit manipulations. When proving that continuous functions on compact sets are uniformly continuous, for instance, we can argue via contradiction: suppose not, then produce sequences violating uniform continuity. Sequential compactness extracts convergent subsequences whose limits expose the contradiction.</p>

        <p>The concept also highlights why completeness alone is insufficient for Bolzano–Weierstrass to hold in general. Banach spaces are complete but may contain bounded sequences without convergent subsequences if they are not reflexive or lack compactness. Sequential compactness therefore demands both boundedness and some form of total boundedness, preventing sequences from scattering among infinitely many almost-disjoint regions.</p>

        <p>In Euclidean spaces, sequential compactness, compactness, and closed-and-bounded coincide, simplifying life. However, in function spaces like \(C[0,1]\) with the supremum norm, sequential compactness requires additional structure, as described by Arzelà–Ascoli: equicontinuity plus pointwise boundedness ensures sequential compactness. These refinements demonstrate how Bolzano–Weierstrass inspires broader criteria in infinite-dimensional contexts.</p>

        <p>Armed with sequential compactness, we can derive powerful consequences. The next article applies the machinery to the extreme value theorem and the Heine–Cantor theorem, showing how compactness begets maxima, minima, and uniform continuity.</p>
