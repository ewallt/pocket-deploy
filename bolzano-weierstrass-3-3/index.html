<section class="p">
<p>A metric space X is sequentially compact if every sequence in X has a subsequence converging to a point in X. This definition extends BWT's conclusion from bounded sequences in ℝ to arbitrary sequences in a space. For subsets of ℝ, BWT implies that closed bounded sets are sequentially compact: any sequence in [a, b] is bounded, hence has a convergent subsequence by BWT, and the limit lies in [a, b] by closedness. Sequential compactness captures the intuition that the space is "tight"—sequences can't escape, they must cluster. It is a sequential analog of the topological compactness (finite subcover property).</p>
<p>In metric spaces, sequential compactness and compactness are closely related but not always equivalent. Every sequentially compact metric space is compact (the topological sense), and every compact metric space is sequentially compact. Thus in metric spaces, the two notions coincide. This equivalence is powerful: it allows us to translate between sequential arguments (often more intuitive and constructive) and covering arguments (often more general and flexible). BWT in ℝ is the sequential compactness of closed bounded intervals, and Heine–Borel is the covering compactness—both facets of the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>The proof that compactness implies sequential compactness in metric spaces uses the concept of completeness and total boundedness. A metric space is totally bounded if for any ε > 0, it can be covered by finitely many ε-balls. Compactness in metric spaces implies total boundedness and completeness. Given a sequence in a compact space, total boundedness lets you repeatedly pass to subsequences living in small regions (a diagonalization or nested-ball argument akin to BWT's bisection), and completeness ensures the limit exists in the space. The argument generalizes BWT's bisection proof to abstract metric spaces, revealing BWT as a concrete instance of a broad principle.</p>
<p>Conversely, sequential compactness implies compactness via a contrapositive argument. Suppose a metric space is sequentially compact. Assume for contradiction it's not (topologically) compact: there's an open cover with no finite subcover. Build a sequence that systematically avoids finite subcoverings (using a Lebesgue number or similar technique). By sequential compactness, extract a convergent subsequence. The limit point belongs to some open set in the cover, which swallows nearby terms, eventually forcing a contradiction—a finite subcover suffices. Thus sequential compactness and compactness are equivalent in metric spaces, unifying sequential and topological perspectives.</p>
<p>Sequential compactness is often easier to check and apply than topological compactness. To show a space is sequentially compact, take an arbitrary sequence and construct a convergent subsequence—a concrete task. To show a space is (topologically) compact, you must handle all possible open covers, an abstract and often cumbersome verification. In ℝⁿ and other nice spaces, Heine–Borel gives a simple criterion (closed + bounded), but in general metric spaces, sequential compactness provides an accessible gateway. Many existence proofs in analysis proceed by taking a sequence (trial solutions, approximations, iterates) and extracting a convergent subsequence—sequential compactness in action.</p>
<p>BWT is the prototypical example: it says ℝ with the usual metric restricted to a bounded set (which we then close) is sequentially compact. Generalizing, we recognize that BWT isn't just a theorem about real sequences but a manifestation of compactness in the sequential language. Other spaces—ℝⁿ, function spaces with appropriate topologies, spaces of probability measures—have their own versions of BWT, usually stated as sequential compactness. Understanding BWT as the ℝ instance of sequential compactness clarifies its role and prepares you to recognize and use compactness arguments in diverse settings. Sequences, subsequences, and limits form the backbone of analysis, and sequential compactness is the unifying concept that makes boundedness yield convergence.</p>
