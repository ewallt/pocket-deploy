<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 4 · Philosophical Considerations: Logic, Time, and Possibility</p>
<article>
<p>The metaphysics of time proves crucial for Open Theism's plausibility. Presentism—the view that only the present exists—provides the most natural metaphysical framework. If past events no longer exist and future events don't yet exist, then there are no future facts for God to know. The future is ontologically open, a realm of possibilities rather than actualities. God knows the present exhaustively, remembers the past completely, and perfectly understands all future possibilities with their probabilities. But until free creatures make choices, those choices don't exist to be known. Eternalism—the view that all temporal moments exist equally, with temporal passage being merely perspectival—makes Open Theism harder to sustain. If the future already exists in some atemporal sense, God should have access to it. Open theists generally embrace presentism or growing block theories where the past is fixed but the future genuinely open.</p>

<p>Logic of future contingents requires attention. Classical logic assumes bivalence—every proposition is either true or false. But if future contingents lack determinate truth values, how do we reason about them? Open theists have developed various responses. Some embrace three-valued logic where future contingents receive a third value (indeterminate) rather than true or false. Others deny that future contingent propositions have truth values at all—they're neither true nor false nor indeterminate, but rather not truth-apt until the relevant time arrives. Still others modify the logic of temporal operators, developing open future semantics where statements about the future are evaluated differently than statements about present or past. Critics charge that abandoning bivalence creates logical chaos. Advocates argue that reality's structure should determine logic, not vice versa, and if the future is genuinely open, logic must accommodate that metaphysical fact.</p>

<p>The nature of possibility and actuality becomes complex in Open Theist framework. God knows all possible futures—every way events might unfold depending on free choices made. As those choices occur, possibilities collapse into actualities. What was possible but unchosen becomes counterfactual—what might have been but wasn't. God's knowledge evolves as the world actualizes one path through the decision tree of possibilities. Critics worry this makes God's knowledge mutable and imperfect, always catching up to newly actualized facts. Open theists respond that God's knowledge remains perfect—always knowing all that is knowable—even while its content changes as reality itself changes. Knowing all actual truths, as actuality grows through temporal process, is perfect knowledge. The alternative—knowing facts before they exist—would be logically incoherent.</p>

<p>Libertarian freedom stands at the heart of Open Theist commitment. Free will in the libertarian sense means agents genuinely could have done otherwise in identical circumstances. The choice is not determined by prior causes, character, desires, or any other factors, though all may influence without necessitating. This contrasts with compatibilist freedom where acts count as free if they flow from the agent's desires without external compulsion, even if those desires themselves are determined. Compatibilism allows affirming both freedom and causal determinism. Open theists insist libertarian freedom is necessary for moral responsibility, genuine relationship, and authentic love. If choices are determined, praise and blame become hollow, and relationship becomes mere theater. Critics charge that libertarian freedom is philosophically problematic—uncaused events seem random rather than free, and how agents cause actions without being determined by their character remains mysterious.</p>

<p>The grounding problem for counterfactuals challenges Open Theist use of divine knowledge of possibilities. What makes it true that Jones would freely choose coffee in circumstance C if C never occurs? The counterfactual can't be grounded in Jones's actual choice (C doesn't happen), nor in divine decree (that eliminates freedom), nor in Jones's character (that would make the choice determined rather than free). Open theists face similar issues Molinists confront. Some respond by denying that counterfactuals of freedom have determinate truth values—God knows that Jones might choose coffee or tea in C, with certain probabilities, but there's no fact about what Jones would definitely choose. Others argue God's perfect knowledge of all factors allows probabilistic prediction approaching certainty for many counterfactuals. The question is whether genuine libertarian freedom is compatible with determinate facts about what would be freely chosen in non-actual circumstances.</p>

<p>Divine simplicity and immutability come under scrutiny. Classical theism affirms God has no parts or composition and undergoes no real change. Open Theism denies both. God has distinct attributes—knowledge, power, love—even if unified in divine essence. God's knowledge changes as new facts come into being. God's emotional states and decisions respond to temporal events. Critics charge this compromises divine perfection and aseity—if God changes, something external causes that change, making God dependent. Open theists respond that change need not imply imperfection. Growing in knowledge as new knowable facts emerge doesn't represent defect but appropriate epistemic responsiveness. Changing emotions in response to creaturely choices demonstrates perfect love, not dependence or imperfection. The disagreement concerns what constitutes perfection—immutable self-sufficiency or responsive relational engagement. The question is whether philosophical theology should begin from biblical narratives or from abstract perfection concepts.</p>

<p>The coherence of Open Theism itself remains contested. Can a being be omniscient while lacking exhaustive foreknowledge? Can sovereignty coexist with genuine risk? Can maximal power include inability to control free creatures? Open theists answer yes to all these, arguing that properly understood, their positions are coherent. Omniscience means knowing all truths; if future contingents aren't yet true, not knowing them doesn't violate omniscience. Sovereignty means ruling effectively toward intended ends; meticulous control isn't necessary. Maximal power means ability to do all that is logically possible; creating genuinely free beings entails inability to control their free choices, but this follows from the nature of freedom, not from any lack in divine power. Critics suspect these are ad hoc redefinitions designed to evade obvious problems. Advocates see them as conceptually sophisticated responses to legitimate philosophical difficulties. Whether Open Theism achieves internal coherence while preserving essential divine attributes depends partly on assessing these philosophical moves' success.</p>
