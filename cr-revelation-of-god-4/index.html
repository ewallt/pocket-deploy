<section class="p">
<p>Humans have long projected their anxieties onto heaven. Kings imagine a sovereign who secures order by force. Victims envision a judge who never listens. Cynics expect silence. These images echo our wounds more than God’s reality. Scripture records them not as endorsements, but as the raw materials God patiently reshapes.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding grows where trust is thin. If God is thought unpredictable, every hardship is read as punishment. If He is seen as distant, prayer becomes performance. The Bible’s story counters this by letting character accumulate: promise upon promise, mercy upon mercy, a portrait built by consistency rather than spectacle.</p>
<p>Jesus reinterprets the record. “You have heard…but I say to you” is more than moral instruction; it is a revelation of the Father’s intent behind the letter. He forbids revenge, unmasks hypocrisy, and elevates compassion over ritual, turning the law into a window rather than a wall.</p>
<p>At the cross, the mirror cracks. We see what sin does to love—and what love does for sinners. God does not stand over violence; He absorbs it. The silence on Friday is not abandonment but self-control; the shout “It is finished” is not resignation but completion.</p>
<p>Resurrection confirms the interpretation. The Father who seemed absent vindicates the Son who trusted Him. The scars remain, not to haunt but to teach: the truth about God is costly to reveal because lies about Him are stubbornly cherished.</p>
<p>To behold God truly we must let Christ govern our reading of everything else—law, prophets, providence, and pain. The more clearly He is seen, the less room remains for the masks we once mistook for God’s face.</p>
