<h1>Galois Theory: Perspectives and Legacy</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · Infinite Galois Theory</p>
<article>
<p>Classical Galois theory, as developed for finite extensions, establishes a correspondence between subgroups of a finite Galois group and intermediate fields. However, many important field extensions are infinite, such as the algebraic closure ℚ̄ of ℚ (the field of all algebraic numbers), or the maximal abelian extension of a number field. To handle these cases, infinite Galois theory extends the Fundamental Theorem by equipping the Galois group with a topology—the Krull topology—making it a profinite group. With this topological structure, the correspondence between closed subgroups and intermediate fields is restored, and the theory applies to arbitrarily large extensions. Infinite Galois theory is essential in algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and the study of field arithmetic, providing a framework for understanding the symmetries of infinite algebraic systems.</p>
<p>For an infinite Galois extension K/F, the Galois group Gal(K/F) consists of all F-automorphisms of K, which may be an infinite set. The Krull topology on Gal(K/F) is defined by taking as a basis of open sets the stabilizers of finite subextensions: for each finite Galois subextension E/F with F ⊆ E ⊆ K, the subgroup Gal(K/E) (automorphisms fixing E pointwise) is declared open. These subgroups are also closed, and their finite intersections and arbitrary unions generate the full topology. Under the Krull topology, Gal(K/F) becomes a compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected topological group—a profinite group. This topology ensures that Galois groups behave well under limits and that the algebraic structure of field extensions is reflected in the topological structure of their Galois groups.</p>
<p>A profinite group is an inverse limit of finite groups. Specifically, Gal(K/F) ≅ lim Gal(E/F) as E ranges over finite Galois subextensions of K/F. Each Gal(E/F) is a finite group with the discrete topology, and the inverse limit inherits a natural compact topology. Elements of Gal(K/F) can be viewed as compatible sequences of automorphisms (σ_E) where σ_E ∈ Gal(E/F) and the automorphisms cohere across extensions. This inverse limit perspective makes explicit that infinite Galois groups encode the collective behavior of all finite subextensions, capturing the idea that K is the union of its finite Galois subfields. Profiniteness is a crucial property: it implies that every open subgroup has finite index, and the group is residually finite, meaning the intersection of all finite-index subgroups is trivial.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Theorem of Infinite Galois Theory asserts that there is a bijection between intermediate fields L (F ⊆ L ⊆ K) and closed subgroups H of Gal(K/F), given by L ↦ Gal(K/L) and H ↦ K^H (the fixed field). This bijection reverses inclusion, as in the finite case. Crucially, the subgroups must be closed in the Krull topology; not every subgroup corresponds to an intermediate field. For example, in Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ) (the absolute Galois group of ℚ), proper dense subgroups exist, but they do not fix any intermediate field strictly between ℚ and ℚ̄. The topology thus plays an essential role, filtering out pathological subgroups and ensuring the correspondence remains well-behaved. The theorem also states that [K:L] equals the index [Gal(K/F):Gal(K/L)] when both are finite, and that L/F is Galois if and only if Gal(K/L) is a normal (closed) subgroup of Gal(K/F).</p>
<p>A canonical example is the extension ℚ̄/ℚ, where ℚ̄ is the algebraic closure of ℚ (the field of all complex numbers algebraic over ℚ). This is an infinite extension, and its Galois group G_ℚ = Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ), called the absolute Galois group of ℚ, is a profinite group of profound importance in number theory. Every finite Galois extension K/ℚ corresponds to a finite quotient of G_ℚ: there is a surjective homomorphism G_ℚ → Gal(K/ℚ) with kernel Gal(ℚ̄/K). Thus, G_ℚ encodes all finite Galois extensions of ℚ simultaneously. Understanding G_ℚ is a central goal of modern number theory, related to the inverse Galois problem (which finite groups occur as Gal(K/ℚ)?), the Langlands program, and the study of motives. Although G_ℚ is not explicitly known, its structure is constrained by deep conjectures and partial results.</p>
<p>Another important example is the maximal abelian extension ℚ^ab of ℚ, the compositum of all finite abelian extensions (equivalently, the largest subfield of ℚ̄ whose Galois group over ℚ is abelian). By the Kronecker-Weber theorem, ℚ^ab equals the compositum of all cyclotomic fields ℚ(ζₙ). The Galois group Gal(ℚ^ab/ℚ) is the abelianization of G_ℚ and is isomorphic to the profinite completion ℤ̂* of the multiplicative group ℤ* (units in the profinite integers ℤ̂). Explicitly, Gal(ℚ^ab/ℚ) ≅ ∏ₚ ℤₚ*, the product over all primes p of the p-adic units ℤₚ*. This is a compact abelian group, and the Artin reciprocity map establishes an isomorphism between Gal(ℚ^ab/ℚ) and the idele class group of ℚ, a fundamental result in class field theory. This example shows how infinite Galois theory connects field extensions to adelic structures in number theory.</p>
<p>Infinite Galois theory also arises in the study of function fields and algebraic geometry. For a smooth projective curve over a finite field 𝔽_q, the function field K has an algebraic closure K̄, and Gal(K̄/K) is a profinite group encoding geometric information about the curve and its coverings. The étale fundamental group π₁^et(X) of a scheme X generalizes the classical fundamental group from topology to algebraic geometry, and for a variety over a field F, π₁^et(X) is closely related to Gal(F̄/F), where F̄ is an algebraic closure. This connection, developed by Grothendieck, extends Galois theory to a geometric context, where "coverings" correspond to field extensions and "automorphisms" correspond to deck transformations. Infinite Galois theory thus provides a unifying language for algebra, number theory, and geometry, demonstrating the breadth and depth of Galois's original insights when extended beyond the finite case.</p>
