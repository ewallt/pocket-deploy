<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 1 · Criticisms of Open Theism from Classical Theists</p>
<article>
<p>The most fundamental criticism claims Open Theism denies divine omniscience. If God does not know future free choices, critics argue, then there are truths God does not know, violating the definition of omniscience. Biblical passages declaring that God knows all things (1 John 3:20), knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10), and possesses perfect knowledge (Job 37:16) seem incompatible with ignorance of future contingents. Open theists respond that omniscience means knowing all truths, and propositions about undetermined futures lack truth values. God knows everything that is knowable; unknowable logical impossibilities—like square circles or undetermined futures—don't count against omniscience. Critics find this distinction unconvincing, arguing that if Jones will choose coffee tomorrow, the proposition "Jones will choose coffee" is true today, and God's perfect knowledge includes it.</p>

<p>Classical theists charge that Open Theism compromises divine sovereignty and providence. If God does not know and control all future events, how can God guarantee that redemptive purposes will be accomplished? The promise that God works all things for good (Romans 8:28) seems empty if God faces surprises and must improvise responses to unexpected developments. Biblical prophecy appears unreliable if God cannot ensure predicted events occur. The assurance that God is working out a plan (Ephesians 1:11) rings hollow if much of history unfolds in ways God did not foresee or intend. Open theists respond that sovereignty doesn't require meticulous control, and God's unsurpassable wisdom suffices to accomplish purposes through wise engagement with free creatures. Critics find this inadequate, seeing it as wishful thinking rather than biblical assurance.</p>

<p>The problem of prophecy generates significant critical pressure. Detailed predictions fulfilled in biblical history—Cyrus named centuries in advance, Messianic prophecies specifying birthplace and manner of death, Jesus predicting Peter's denial—seem to require exhaustive foreknowledge. Open theists offer various explanations: conditional prophecy, divine intentions God will ensure, probabilistic prediction based on perfect knowledge of likelihoods, or later theological reflection shaped into prophetic form. Critics find these responses ad hoc and exegetically strained. The simplest explanation for fulfilled prediction, they argue, is that God knew the future comprehensively. Attempts to explain prophecy without foreknowledge multiply hypotheses and strain credulity. The cumulative weight of biblical prediction, classical theists contend, refutes Open Theism decisively.</p>

<p>Philosophical objections focus on the coherence of denying future truth values. The principle of bivalence—every proposition is either true or false—seems fundamental to logic. If "Jones will choose coffee tomorrow" is neither true nor false today, how do we reason about the future? Can we meaningfully say anything about it? Modal logic requires evaluating possibilities and actualities; if future contingents have no truth value, the logical machinery breaks down. Open theists respond by developing three-valued or open-future logics where future contingents receive a third value or no value. Critics charge that abandoning bivalence creates more problems than it solves, rendering reasoning about the future logically unstable. If Open Theism requires rejecting fundamental logical principles, classical theists argue, it has discredited itself through reductio ad absurdum.</p>

<p>Practical and pastoral concerns arise regarding believers' confidence and assurance. If the future is genuinely open and God faces possibilities rather than certainties, how can Christians rest assured that God's promises will be fulfilled? What guarantees that Christ will return, that justice will prevail, that God's kingdom will come? The comfort believers derive from divine foreordination—that nothing happens by accident, all is part of God's plan—seems lost if God is navigating genuine uncertainty. Open theists respond that believers can trust God's character, power, and wisdom to accomplish intended ends without requiring a predetermined script. God's promise-keeping doesn't require exhaustive foreknowledge, only sufficient power and wisdom. Critics find this psychologically and spiritually unsatisfying, arguing that robust Christian assurance requires comprehensive divine control.</p>

<p>Theological tradition weighs heavily in criticisms. Open Theism stands outside the mainstream of historic Christian orthodoxy, rejected by Catholic, Orthodox, and most Protestant traditions. The consensus of church fathers, medieval theologians, Reformers, and confessional statements affirms exhaustive divine foreknowledge. Open Theism's novelty and marginality count against it, critics argue. Christianity is a historic faith with doctrinal boundaries; innovative proposals claiming biblical support while contradicting tradition rightly face suspicion. Open theists respond that tradition, while valuable, is not infallible. Scripture alone is the final authority, and faithful interpretation sometimes requires challenging received traditions. The Protestant principle of semper reformanda—always reforming according to Scripture—licenses reconsideration of traditional doctrines when biblical and philosophical arguments warrant. The question is whether respect for tradition becomes traditionalism that stifles legitimate theological development.</p>

<p>Some critics charge Open Theism with diminishing God to fit human categories. The God of Open Theism seems too much like a very powerful, very wise human facing an uncertain future and doing his best. This allegedly contradicts the biblical emphasis on God's transcendence, majesty, and otherness. God's ways are higher than human ways (Isaiah 55:8-9); God's knowledge surpasses human understanding. Open Theism domesticates this transcendent God, making him comprehensible by reducing him to temporal limitation. Open theists respond that the charge conflates transcendence with philosophical abstraction. The biblical God is transcendent in power, holiness, and faithful love, not in metaphysical remoteness. A God who experiences time, responds to prayer, and relates personally is more biblical than the immutable, impassible, timeless God of classical theism. The question is what kind of transcendence Scripture teaches and whether Greek philosophical categories better capture it than Hebrew relational categories.</p>
