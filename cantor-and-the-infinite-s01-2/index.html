<h1>Cantor and the Infinite: Revolutionizing Numbers</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · Introducing Sets: Cantor's Basic Language</p>
<article>
<p>Cantor's theory of sets begins with a deceptively simple idea: a set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as a whole. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. A set can contain anything—numbers, points, functions, even other sets. What matters is not the nature of the elements but their collection into a unified mathematical object. Cantor famously described a set as "a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought." This intuitive notion provided the foundation for comparing infinite collections, allowing mathematicians to reason rigorously about the infinite for the first time.</p>

<p>Sets are typically denoted by capital letters (A, B, C) and their elements by lowercase letters (a, b, c). Membership is indicated by the symbol ∈: if x is an element of set A, we write x ∈ A. If x is not in A, we write x ∉ A. Sets can be specified by listing their elements explicitly in braces, such as A = {1, 2, 3}, or by stating a property that characterizes the elements, such as B = {x : x is an even natural number}. Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same elements, regardless of order or repetition: {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1} = {1, 1, 2, 3}. This simple language, though informal, enabled Cantor to define operations and relationships between sets with precision.</p>

<p>A set A is a subset of set B, written A ⊆ B, if every element of A is also an element of B. For example, {1, 2} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4}. Every set is a subset of itself, and the empty set ∅ (the set with no elements) is a subset of every set. If A ⊆ B and A ≠ B, we say A is a proper subset of B, sometimes written A ⊂ B. The power set of a set A, denoted P(A) or 2^A, is the set of all subsets of A. For instance, if A = {1, 2}, then P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}, containing 2² = 4 elements. Cantor proved that for any set A, the power set P(A) has strictly more elements than A itself, a result central to understanding different sizes of infinity.</p>

<p>The union of two sets A and B, denoted A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that belong to A, to B, or to both: A ∪ B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}. For example, {1, 2} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}. The intersection A ∩ B is the set of elements common to both A and B: A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}. If A ∩ B = ∅, the sets are called disjoint. The difference A \ B (or A − B) consists of elements in A but not in B: A \ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B}. These operations—union, intersection, difference—allow construction of new sets from existing ones, building a rich algebraic structure analogous to arithmetic operations on numbers.</p>

<p>Cantor extended these operations to infinite collections. The union of infinitely many sets A₁, A₂, A₃, ... is the set of all elements belonging to at least one Aᵢ, denoted ⋃_{i=1}^∞ Aᵢ or ⋃ᵢ Aᵢ. Similarly, the intersection ⋂ᵢ Aᵢ consists of elements common to all sets Aᵢ. These infinite operations require care: one must ensure the result is well-defined and avoid paradoxes. For instance, the union of all finite sets of natural numbers is not itself a set of natural numbers but rather the set of all natural numbers. Such subtleties, initially overlooked, later led to foundational crises and the need for axiomatic set theory. Cantor's original formulation was naive, relying on intuition rather than formal axioms, but it was extraordinarily fruitful.</p>

<p>Cartesian products combine sets into ordered pairs. The Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. For example, {1, 2} × {x, y} = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)}. If A and B are infinite, A × B is also infinite. Cantor used Cartesian products to analyze functions and relations. A function f: A → B is a subset of A × B satisfying the condition that for each a ∈ A, there is exactly one b ∈ B such that (a, b) ∈ f. Functions, in set-theoretic terms, are special relations—sets of ordered pairs. This perspective unified analysis, algebra, and logic under a common set-theoretic framework, demonstrating the versatility and power of Cantor's language.</p>

<p>Cantor's set-theoretic language revolutionized mathematics by providing a universal vocabulary. Previously, mathematicians spoke of numbers, functions, geometrical figures, and algebraic structures in separate, specialized languages. Cantor showed that all these could be viewed as sets: natural numbers as elements of ℕ, real numbers as infinite sets of rationals (via Dedekind cuts or equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences), functions as sets of ordered pairs. This unification was conceptually profound, revealing deep connections between different branches of mathematics. Set theory became the lingua franca of mathematics, the foundational language in which all other mathematical structures could be expressed and analyzed. Cantor's basic language—simple, intuitive, yet powerful—laid the groundwork for the modern mathematical edifice, transforming how mathematicians think about collections, infinity, and the very nature of mathematical objects.</p>
