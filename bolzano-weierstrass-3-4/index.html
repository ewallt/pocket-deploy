<section class="p">
<p>The Extreme Value Theorem (EVT) states: if f is continuous on a compact set K, then f attains its maximum and minimum on K. In ℝ, this means a continuous function on [a, b] reaches its supremum and infimum—there exist points c, d ∈ [a, b] with f(c) = sup f and f(d) = inf f. This is a fundamental result in calculus and optimization: you're guaranteed extrema exist, not just as limits but as actual function values. The proof hinges on compactness, specifically the sequential compactness provided by BWT. Without compactness, continuous functions can fail to attain extrema—consider f(x) = x on (0, 1), which is continuous but has no maximum on the open interval.</p>
<p>The proof of EVT via BWT: let M = sup{f(x) : x ∈ K}. By definition of supremum, for each n, there exists xₙ ∈ K with f(xₙ) > M − 1/n. The sequence (xₙ) lies in the compact set K, so by sequential compactness (BWT in ℝ context), it has a subsequence xₙₖ → c for some c ∈ K. Continuity of f gives f(xₙₖ) → f(c). But f(xₙₖ) → M by the squeeze theorem (since M − 1/nₖ < f(xₙₖ) ≤ M and 1/nₖ → 0). Thus f(c) = M, and the supremum is attained. The same argument applies to the infimum. BWT guarantees the convergent subsequence; compactness ensures c ∈ K; continuity ensures the function value converges. All pieces lock together.</p>
<p>EVT's power is existential: it guarantees a solution without constructing it. In optimization, EVT assures you that a continuous objective over a compact feasible set has an optimal solution. You may not compute it exactly, but you know it exists, so numerical methods can sensibly seek it. The theorem transforms "supremum" (an abstract bound) into "maximum" (an achieved value). This shift from potential to actual is characteristic of compactness: compactness makes limits and bounds tangible. Without BWT and compactness, EVT would fail, and continuous functions could approach but never reach their bounds.</p>
<p>The Heine–Cantor Theorem asserts: if f is continuous on a compact metric space K, then f is uniformly continuous on K. Uniform continuity strengthens pointwise continuity: for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x, y ∈ K with d(x, y) < δ, we have |f(x) − f(y)| < ε. The key is δ works uniformly for all x, not varying point by point. On compact sets, continuity automatically upgrades to uniform continuity. For example, f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, 1) but not uniformly continuous (δ must shrink near 0). On [1/2, 1], a compact set, it is uniformly continuous.</p>
<p>Proof of Heine–Cantor via BWT: suppose f is continuous on compact K but not uniformly continuous. Then for some ε > 0, no δ works—meaning for each δ = 1/n, there exist xₙ, yₙ ∈ K with d(xₙ, yₙ) < 1/n but |f(xₙ) − f(yₙ)| ≥ ε. The sequences (xₙ) and (yₙ) lie in compact K, so by BWT, extract a convergent subsequence xₙₖ → x ∈ K. Since d(xₙₖ, yₙₖ) < 1/nₖ → 0, we also have yₙₖ → x. Continuity at x implies f(xₙₖ) → f(x) and f(yₙₖ) → f(x), so |f(xₙₖ) − f(yₙₖ)| → 0, contradicting |f(xₙₖ) − f(yₙₖ)| ≥ ε. Thus f must be uniformly continuous. Again, BWT supplies the convergent subsequence that drives the proof.</p>
<p>Both EVT and Heine–Cantor illustrate how compactness, via BWT, forces good behavior. Continuity alone can be fragile—functions on non-compact domains may lack extrema or uniform continuity. Compactness tightens the space, preventing pathologies. The common proof technique is: assume failure, construct a problematic sequence, apply BWT to extract a convergent subsequence, use continuity and the limit to derive a contradiction. This pattern recurs throughout analysis: compactness (sequential form via BWT) converts pointwise properties (continuity, boundedness) into uniform or global properties (attained extrema, uniform continuity). BWT is the workhorse enabling these leaps from local to global.</p>
