<header class="h"><h1>The Clockwork Cosmos</h1><p>How the dream of perfect predictability captured the imagination of science.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>In the 18th century, determinism seemed not just plausible but inevitable. Newton’s laws had unified the heavens and the Earth, demonstrating that motion everywhere obeyed precise, mathematical regularities. The universe resembled an immense clock wound by God at creation and left to tick forever, each gear following mechanical necessity.</p>
<p>Pierre-Simon Laplace gave this vision its most striking form. His “demon,” an intellect knowing all forces and positions of particles, could calculate the entire future and reconstruct the entire past. Nothing was uncertain; ignorance, not indeterminacy, limited prediction. In this cosmos, freedom was illusion and chance mere shorthand for ignorance.</p>
<p>Determinism offered both intellectual comfort and moral anxiety. It promised order, predictability, and rationality, but threatened meaning, responsibility, and divine providence. If the world ran by necessity, what room remained for choice or miracle?</p>
<p>In practice, the success of mechanics and astronomy reinforced faith in the deterministic ideal. Halley predicted eclipses; engineers built bridges that never collapsed. The more precisely science worked, the more metaphysical confidence it inspired.</p>
<p>Yet even then, cracks were forming. Turbulent fluids, chemical reactions, and biological growth defied simple prediction. Determinism survived by postponing its limits—assuming that deeper equations would one day explain the irregular.</p>
<p>By the dawn of the 19th century, the mechanical universe stood triumphant but brittle. Its perfection relied on an impossible ideal: infinite precision in measurement and computation. Beneath its polished gears lay seeds of uncertainty waiting to sprout.</p>
