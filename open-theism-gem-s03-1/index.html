<h1>Open Theism: Criticisms, Implications, and Contemporary Relevance</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 11 · Criticisms of Open Theism: Challenges from Classical Theists</p>
<article>
<p>Open Theism has faced significant criticism from classical theologians, who argue that it presents a diminished view of God and departs from historical orthodoxy. These objections center on key theological doctrines, particularly God's sovereignty, omniscience, and the reliability of Scripture.</p>
<p><strong>1. It Undermines God's Sovereignty:</strong> This is perhaps the most common criticism. If God does not know the future choices of free agents, critics argue, then He cannot be in complete control of history. The future becomes a product of both divine and human actions, which seems to give creatures an unsettling degree of power. Classical theists contend that God's meticulous providence—His ability to ordain and govern every detail—is essential for the believer's trust and confidence. An "open" future seems to introduce an element of risk and uncertainty that is incompatible with a truly sovereign God.</p>
<p><strong>2. It Denies God's Omniscience:</strong> Critics argue that by redefining omniscience to exclude knowledge of future contingents, Open Theism is effectively saying God is not all-knowing. If there is a truth about the future (e.g., "John will choose X tomorrow"), then an omniscient being must know it. To say God doesn't know it is to limit His knowledge. They reject the Open Theist claim that there are no truths about future free choices, arguing that this is a philosophical assumption rather than a biblical teaching. This redefinition, they claim, creates a lesser God who is limited and reactive.</p>
<p><strong>3. It Devalues Biblical Prophecy:</strong> As discussed previously, classical theists believe that precise, predictive prophecy is one of the strongest proofs of God's divinity and the inspiration of Scripture. They argue that the Open Theist model—with its emphasis on conditional prophecies and God's intentions—cannot adequately account for prophecies that predict specific, contingent events centuries in advance. This, they fear, weakens the trustworthiness of God's promises and the authority of the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>4. It Misinterprets Scripture:</strong> Classical theologians contend that Open Theists build their case on a selective reading of narrative passages while failing to properly interpret didactic, propositional texts about God's nature. They argue that passages describing God "relenting" or "regretting" are clear examples of anthropomorphism (attributing human characteristics to God) and should not be used to redefine God's core attributes of immutability and omniscience, which are more clearly taught elsewhere (e.g., Malachi 3:6, "I the LORD do not change"; Isaiah 46:10, "declaring the end from the beginning").</p>
<p><strong>5. It Offers False Comfort:</strong> While Open Theists believe their view provides comfort by absolving God of responsibility for evil, critics argue it does the opposite. A God who is not in complete control and who can be surprised by events is not a God who can guarantee that all things will work together for good (Romans 8:28). The comfort of classical theism lies in the belief that even in the midst of suffering and chaos, a sovereign God is working out His perfect plan. An open future, critics say, replaces this confidence with uncertainty and anxiety.</p>
