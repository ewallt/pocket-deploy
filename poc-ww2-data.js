        summary: "On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland from the west, north, and south; on 17 September, the USSR invaded from the east under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Rapid German mechanized thrusts, close air support, and encirclements overwhelmed Polish defenses despite stubborn resistance at places like Westerplatte, the Bzura, and Warsaw. By early October, organized Polish resistance had collapsed and Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned the country, triggering Britain and France’s declarations of war on Germany and the start of WWII in Europe.",
