The Content of the 1888 Message: Righteousness by Faith in Christ Alone
1. Overview
The content of the 1888 message centers on a renewed, Christ-focused proclamation of righteousness by faith. It emphasizes that salvation is grounded wholly in the person and work of Jesus Christ, received by faith as a gift, and that obedience to the law is a fruit of this faith rather than its basis. Within the Adventist context, this message sought to correct a growing imbalance in which law, prophecy, and distinctives overshadowed the gospel, and it aimed to integrate righteousness by faith with the three angels’ messages as their living heart.
The 1888 emphasis did not discard Adventist teachings on the law, the Sabbath, or prophecy. Instead, it insisted that these distinctives must be rooted in and energized by a robust understanding of the cross, the righteousness of Christ, and the relational reality of justification by faith.

2. Justification by Faith as Center
2.1 Justification Grounded in Christ Alone
At the heart of the message is the affirmation that sinners are justified solely on the basis of Christ’s righteousness:
Christ’s life and death constitute the only ground of acceptance with God.


Human works, law-keeping, or religious performance contribute nothing to the merit that justifies the sinner.


Faith receives what Christ has already accomplished rather than offering something to complete it.


This emphasis underscores the objective reality of salvation as something accomplished in Christ and offered to all, not a cooperative project whose success depends on human contribution.
2.2 Faith as Reception, Not Achievement
Faith itself is understood as the means by which the believer receives Christ’s righteousness:
Faith is not a work that earns favor but the hand that takes hold of a gift already provided.


The focus is on trusting the goodness, reliability, and promises of God as revealed in Jesus.


Faith looks away from self, performance, and feelings to the sufficiency of Christ.


In this view, the call to believe is a call to relinquish self-reliance and rest in what Christ has done, rather than to produce a certain level or quality of internal effort.

3. Relationship Between Law and Gospel
3.1 Law as Revealer of Sin and Schoolmaster
The 1888 message affirmed the enduring validity of God’s law while insisting on its proper function:
The law reveals sin, exposes the true condition of the heart, and shows the sinner’s need of a Savior.


It serves as a “schoolmaster” to lead the sinner to Christ, not as a ladder by which one climbs to salvation.


The law cannot justify or impart life; it can only point beyond itself to the One who can.


In this framework, conviction of sin and recognition of the law’s claims are preparatory works of the Spirit that drive the sinner to Christ, where justification and new life are found.
3.2 Obedience as Fruit of Justification
Obedience to the law is essential, but its place is carefully defined:
Obedience is the result of justification by faith, not a prerequisite that earns it.


The believer who has received Christ’s righteousness is empowered by the Spirit to walk in harmony with God’s law.


Genuine obedience springs from gratitude and love, not from fear of punishment or desire for reward.


Thus law and gospel are not enemies but partners in a specific order: the law leads to Christ, Christ justifies, and the justified believer walks in obedience out of a heart transformed by grace.

4. Christ’s Person and Righteousness
4.1 Full Divinity and Sufficiency of Christ
The message presents a high view of Christ:
Christ is fully divine, sharing the fullness of the Godhead, worthy of the same honor as the Father.


His righteousness is perfect, complete, and sufficient for every believer.


To possess Christ by faith is to possess all the righteousness needed for acceptance with God.


By exalting Christ’s person, the message undermines semi-Arian or diminished views of the Son and centers salvation on the infinite worth and power of the Savior.
4.2 Union with Christ
Believers are justified as they are united with Christ by faith:
The Spirit brings the believer into a living union with the risen Lord.


In this union, Christ’s righteousness is counted as theirs (justification) and begins to be reproduced in their life (sanctification).


This union is relational and covenantal, not merely formal or legal.


The emphasis on union with Christ guards against a cold, transactional understanding of justification and highlights the personal, transformative nature of faith.

5. Assurance and the Heart of the Gospel
5.1 Assurance Based on Christ’s Work
The 1888 message offers a clear basis for assurance:
Assurance is grounded in Christ’s finished work, not in fluctuating feelings or variable performance.


The believer may have confidence before God because Christ’s righteousness is stable and perfect.


Doubt and uncertainty are met, not with introspective self-analysis, but with repeated focus on the cross and the promises of God.


In this way, the message seeks to free believers from anxiety and legalistic striving by directing their trust toward the reliability of God’s grace in Christ.
5.2 Love as the Motive for Obedience
The experience of justification by faith awakens love:
When the believer sees Christ’s self-giving love, fear is displaced by gratitude.


Love becomes the primary motive for obedience, service, and sacrifice.


The Christian life is recast as a response to grace rather than an attempt to earn it.


This reshaping of motive is central to the message’s critique of legalism and its call to deeper, heart-level religion.

6. Integration with the Three Angels’ Messages
6.1 Third Angel’s Message “in Verity”
Within the Adventist context, the 1888 message was identified as the third angel’s message “in verity”:
The third angel’s message—centered on commandment-keeping and the faith of Jesus—is understood as a gospel message, not merely a warning.


The faith of Jesus is interpreted as a deep, trusting union with Christ, whose righteousness is the only ground of acceptance.


Righteousness by faith is presented as the core reality that makes end-time obedience meaningful rather than legalistic.


By framing righteousness by faith as the very essence of the third angel’s message, the 1888 content reorients Adventist eschatology around the gospel.
6.2 Christ at the Center of Distinctive Truths
Adventist distinctives—Sabbath, sanctuary, judgment, prophetic identity—are integrated with the gospel:
The Sabbath is seen as a sign of rest in Christ’s finished work, not merely a test of loyalty.


The sanctuary and judgment messages are interpreted in the light of Christ’s ongoing priestly ministry and the assurance offered by His righteousness.


Prophetic identity is seen as a call to bear a unique, Christ-centered message of grace and truth to the world.


In this way, the 1888 content does not diminish Adventist uniqueness but seeks to ensure that it radiates from a clear, compelling presentation of Christ and His righteousness.

7. Correcting Imbalances and Misunderstandings
The 1888 emphasis implicitly and explicitly addressed several imbalances that had developed:
Overemphasis on the law without corresponding attention to the gospel.


A tendency to measure spiritual life by external observances and doctrinal assent.


Lack of clarity about assurance, leading to fear-based religion and striving.


By reaffirming justification by faith in Christ alone, the message called the church to:
Re-center preaching and teaching on the person and work of Christ.


Present obedience as the fruit of a living relationship with Jesus.


Help believers find peace with God on the basis of His grace, thereby enabling deeper, more genuine holiness.



8. Enduring Themes
The content of the 1888 message continues to raise enduring questions:
How can a law-honoring, commandment-keeping faith remain fully gospel-centered?


What does it mean to proclaim the three angels’ messages in a way that is clearly good news?


How can the church guard against legalism while still taking obedience and holiness seriously?


At its core, the 1888 message insists that the answer lies in keeping Christ and His righteousness at the center: justification by faith as the foundation, sanctification as its fruit, and the entire Adventist end-time witness as an extension of the good news of what God has done and is doing in Christ.
