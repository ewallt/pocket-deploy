<header class="h"><h1>Unto You a Saviour — Part 4: Peace on Earth</h1><p class="intro">The angels announce not a ceasefire but the arrival of shalom—wholeness flowing from reconciliation with the God who draws near.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>“Peace on earth” does not mean the absence of tension; it names the presence of a Person whose nearness heals reality at its seams. The peace attached to Jesus is not passive resignation or polite avoidance of conflict. It is the active mending of what sin has torn—between God and humanity, within fractured selves, and among estranged neighbors. This peace begins inside, where forgiven hearts stop rehearsing grudges and fearful minds learn to rest. Then it spreads outward, recruiting tongues, hands, and systems into a more truthful way of being together under divine favor.</p>
<p>Luke’s world knew a different “peace,” enforced by legions and maintained by crosses. Against that imperial boast, the manger offers a counter-politics: vulnerability instead of intimidation, truth instead of propaganda, service instead of spectacle. The Child will grow to bless enemies, absorb violence without retaliation, and create a community whose weapons are prayer, bread, and truth-telling. His meekness is not weakness; it is mastery of self for the sake of others. In His company, peace refuses to be reduced to order and insists on justice that protects the small.</p>
<p>Practically, peace takes flesh in habits of listening, confession, and repair. Families learn to narrate hurts without exaggeration and to forgive before sunsets harden hearts. Congregations make room for slow conversations, refusing to trade patience for quick wins. We practice hospitality that lowers defenses and restores dignity: chairs added, names remembered, stories believed. In such spaces, anxiety finds alternatives to control, and anger learns gentler tongues. The world sees that Christianity is not merely a set of claims but a way of carrying those claims that coheres with their content.</p>
<p>Peace also has a public vocation. It compels us to notice who bears the brunt of our indifference and to move toward them with practical solidarity. The Child cherished by Mary will later identify Himself with the hungry, the stranger, the prisoner. If His arrival really is “good will toward men,” then institutions touched by His people should become easier places to be small, to fail, to begin again. Policies will not save us, but they can either frustrate or further the slow work of love. Christian peace lobbies for the latter.</p>
<p>Of course, peacemaking is costly. It risks being misunderstood by partisans, resented by the aggrieved, and exploited by the unscrupulous. Jesus does not hide the price; He pays it. The serenity we admire at Bethlehem will be tested at Gethsemane and vindicated at Calvary. Yet the arc is unbroken: the One who came low will go lower still, proving that the deepest peace is purchased by self-giving, not inflicted by force. That assurance steadies our small attempts to reconcile divided rooms and weary minds.</p>
<p>Therefore the song becomes assignment. We leave the field as the shepherds did, returning to our stations with different postures—slower to speak, quicker to bless, eager to set extra places at the table. We carry a benediction into traffic, inboxes, and meetings. We refuse despair its favorite words: “always” and “never.” And when fear resurfaces, we repeat the angels’ refrain until courage answers: glory to God above us, peace from God among us, favor from God upon us. This is how the earth begins to rest.</p>
