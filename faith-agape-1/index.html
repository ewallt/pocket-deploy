    <h1>Faith as Heart-Appreciation of Agape</h1>
    <p class="sub">Part 1 — What Faith Is</p>

    <p>When Scripture speaks of faith, it does not picture a cold assent to propositions but a living trust that awakens in the presence of love. Faith, in this sense, is less like signing a contract and more like opening the heart to Someone who has already given Himself for us. It is the inner persuasion that God is as good as Jesus reveals Him to be.</p>

    <p>This heart-level trust is relational before it is theoretical. Facts matter—claims can be weighed, reasons counted—but the decisive movement of faith happens when love is seen and welcomed. The mind may clear obstacles; the heart, seeing goodness, consents.</p>

    <p>Because faith is born from love, it cannot be coerced. Threats may force compliance, yet they cannot create trust. Faith grows where agape is revealed: the steady, self-giving posture of God toward His creatures, seeking their good without manipulation.</p>

    <p>Thus faith is not a human achievement that earns favor, but a response to grace. We trust because we are first loved. We yield because we are convincingly shown that the One who calls us is worthy of our confidence.</p>

    <p>This explains why faith is inseparable from knowledge of God’s character. If God were arbitrary or violent in His deepest nature, trust would be fragile or misplaced. But if God is revealed as consistent, truthful, and self-giving, trust can rest without anxiety.</p>

    <p>Faith also implies allegiance. To entrust ourselves to God is to adopt His way of self-giving love as our own. Trust flowers into loyalty, and loyalty begins to reshape the imagination, the habits, and the choices of daily life.</p>

    <p>In short, faith is a heart-appreciation of agape: the awakened confidence that God is good, made plausible to the mind and compelling to the heart. Part 2 explores how the cross reveals this love and how, in seeing it, we change.</p>
