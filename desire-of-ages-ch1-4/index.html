<header class="h"><h1>God With Us — Part 4: Veiled Glory</h1><p class="intro">The Invisible becomes visible without consuming the beholder: divinity tabernacled in humanity.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Scripture remembers moments when God stooped to be near without destroying those He loved: a bush that burned yet was not consumed, a pillar of cloud and fire that guided a stubborn people, a sanctuary where glory was shaded by woven curtains. Each was a mercy of mediation. In Jesus, the mercy reaches its fullness. The Word becomes flesh and “pitches His tent” among us, the same Presence now localized in a life—approachable, conversational, interruptible, yet unmistakably holy.</p>
<p>The veiling is not a disguise but a gift. Were the radiance of uncreated light to blaze unfiltered, we would be undone. So Love limits its brilliance to meet our eyes. The Carpenter’s hands are the Father’s hands; the Teacher’s voice is the Father’s voice; the tears on a friend’s grave are the Father’s heart laid bare. Majesty is not missing; it is gentled, that sinners might draw near without rehearsed defenses. Awe survives familiarity; indeed, it deepens, because holiness is recognized in humility.</p>
<p>Veiled glory dignifies bodies and touch. Jesus does not save from afar; He puts His fingers in ears that cannot hear, lifts faces that dare not look up, lets children climb His knees. The nearness clarifies that salvation is not information only but incarnation—God’s life meeting ours at skin-level. When He says, “I am,” He says it from lungs that tire and a throat that thirsts, so that the Name we feared in thunder can be trusted in a whisper.</p>
<p>This manner of nearness corrects our methods. We do not meet the world as disembodied voices or abstract arguments, but as people whose presence carries the Presence. Truth travels best at walking speed, over meals and along roads, where questions surface naturally and answers can be sized to souls. If the King comes veiled, the kingdom comes gently: sight for the blind, room for the small, rest for the sinner who has run out of performances.</p>
<p>Veiling also explains delay. God moves at the pace of comprehension, giving as much light as love deems safe. In the Gospels, that looks like parables, private explanations, and patient repetition. In our lives, it looks like providences we only recognize in the retelling. The point is not to keep us in the dark but to keep us from being blinded. He means us to see, and to keep seeing, until trust is more than a momentary flare.</p>
<p>One day, the veil will lift and we shall see Him as He is. The preparation for that sight is this one: to attend to the glory already near, in bread broken and neighbors served, in words remembered and prayers breathed. The tabernacled God has made the ordinary luminous. To miss Him now would be to misread the world He lovingly inhabits.</p>
