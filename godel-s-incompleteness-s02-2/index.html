<h1>Gödel's Incompleteness: Proof Sketch</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · The Liar Paradox and Self-Reference: Constructing the Undecidable Statement</p>
<article>
<p>The liar paradox—"This sentence is false"—has troubled logicians since antiquity. If the sentence is true, then it is false as it claims; if false, then it speaks truthfully, making it true. This leads to contradiction, suggesting that self-referential statements can be problematic. Classical logic avoids such paradoxes by restricting which sentences are admissible, distinguishing between object language (statements about the world) and meta-language (statements about statements). Gödel's genius was to construct a mathematical analogue of the liar paradox that does not lead to contradiction but instead to incompleteness. His undecidable statement G asserts "G is not provable," mirroring the liar's structure but replacing truth with provability. This shift from semantic to syntactic self-reference sidesteps paradox while revealing deep limits of formal systems.</p>

<p>To build a self-referential statement, Gödel exploited arithmetization: formulas are represented by Gödel numbers, so arithmetic can express properties of formulas. Consider a property like "the formula with Gödel number x is provable." Call this property Prov(x). If G has Gödel number g, then Prov(g) says "G is provable," and ¬Prov(g) says "G is not provable." Gödel's challenge was to construct a formula G such that G is equivalent to ¬Prov(g), where g is G's own Gödel number. Such a G would assert its own unprovability. The construction relies on a technique called diagonalization, inspired by Cantor's diagonal argument and the liar paradox, but executed rigorously within arithmetic.</p>

<p>Diagonalization begins with a function that takes a formula and a number as input and produces a new formula. Specifically, let φ(x, y) be a formula with two free variables. Gödel defines a substitution operation: sub(n, m) is the Gödel number of the formula obtained by substituting the numeral for m into the variable y in the formula with Gödel number n. This substitution is itself an arithmetic operation on Gödel numbers—intricate but definable. Now consider the formula ψ(y) that asserts "there is no proof of the formula with Gödel number sub(y, y)." Intuitively, ψ(y) says "the formula obtained by substituting y into itself is not provable." Let k be the Gödel number of ψ. Gödel's undecidable statement G is then ψ(k): "there is no proof of the formula with Gödel number sub(k, k)." But sub(k, k) is precisely the Gödel number of ψ(k) itself, i.e., G. Thus, G asserts "G is not provable."</p>

<p>This construction is analogous to the liar paradox but crucially different. The liar sentence refers to its own truth, leading to contradiction. Gödel's G refers to its own provability, a syntactic property, avoiding semantic paradox. If G were provable, then by definition of Prov, there exists a proof, contradicting G's assertion that no proof exists—but this contradiction occurs only if the system is inconsistent. If the system is consistent, G is not provable, which means G's assertion is correct: G is true. Thus, G is a true statement (in the standard model of arithmetic) that the system cannot prove. Unlike the liar, which oscillates between true and false, G settles into a stable state: unprovable and true. This stability is what makes Gödel's construction profound rather than paradoxical.</p>

<p>The diagonalization technique ensures that G is well-defined and expressible within arithmetic. The formula ψ(y) involves quantifying over natural numbers and asserting non-existence of proofs, which translates into an arithmetic statement about Gödel numbers. The substitution function sub(y, y) is primitive recursive—computable by a simple algorithm—hence expressible in PA. Every step of the construction stays within the language of arithmetic. Gödel did not invoke any external meta-mathematical concepts beyond what can be arithmetized. This rigor is essential: if the construction required concepts beyond PA, the self-reference would fail, and the theorem would not apply. Gödel's meticulous encoding ensures that G is a legitimate formula of PA, not an informal or semantic trick.</p>

<p>Historically, Gödel drew inspiration from several sources. Cantor's diagonal argument, proving the uncountability of real numbers, demonstrated the power of self-application: consider the set of all infinite binary sequences, and construct a new sequence differing from each listed sequence at position n. This new sequence cannot be on the list, proving uncountability. Gödel adapted this diagonal method to formulas and provability. Additionally, the Richard paradox and Berry paradox, linguistic puzzles involving self-reference and definability, hinted at deep connections between language and arithmetic. Gödel formalized these intuitions, transforming paradox into a rigorous proof technique. His construction is sometimes called a "Gödelian diagonal argument," a testament to its roots in Cantor's work.</p>

<p>The undecidable statement G is not an exotic outlier but an instance of a general phenomenon. For any consistent, sufficiently strong formal system, one can construct infinitely many such statements. Each new statement, independent of the system, can be added as an axiom, yielding an extended system—which itself is incomplete, admitting another undecidable statement. This recursive nature of incompleteness shows that no finite or even recursively enumerable set of axioms can eliminate all undecidable statements. The liar paradox, once a philosophical curiosity, becomes a mathematical tool: self-reference, properly harnessed through arithmetic encoding, reveals fundamental limits to formalization. Gödel transformed a paradox into a theorem, using self-reference not to destroy logic but to illuminate its boundaries. This ingenious synthesis of logic, arithmetic, and philosophy stands as one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements in mathematics.</p>
