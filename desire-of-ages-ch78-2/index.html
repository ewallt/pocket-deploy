<header class="h"><h1>Calvary — Part 2: “Father, Forgive Them”</h1><p class="intro">The first word from the cross discloses heaven’s policy toward enemies: truth with an open door.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” The plea rises over hammers, insults, and indifference. It is not denial of guilt but description of fog: ignorance thick with pride, fear, and propaganda. Jesus asks that the fog be pierced, that sinners be given time and light to recognize what they have done. Forgiveness here is not amnesia; it is opportunity—the space in which repentance can awaken because love has refused to retaliate.</p>
<p>The prayer is intercession as revelation. We are overhearing the Son’s settled view of us while we are at our worst. Soldiers who follow orders, rulers who protect positions, crowds who enjoy cruelty—all are included in the pronoun. So are disciples who ran and friends who watch from a distance. Calvary demolishes the myth of deserving and replaces it with mercy. If there is hope for these, there is hope for all.</p>
<p>Forgiveness does not make evil safe; it makes change possible. The cross exposes the lie that God saves by crushing enemies and the counter-lie that love is naïve. Jesus names harm, absorbs it, and keeps the door unlocked. Later, many priests will believe; a centurion will confess; thousands in Jerusalem will repent when the truth becomes clear. The first word plants seeds we will see sprout in the book of Acts and in every life that comes into the light.</p>
<p>Practically, the prayer sets a pattern for disciples under injustice. We tell the truth about wounds without staging revenge. We ask the Father to forgive those who harm us, not as performance but as participation in Christ’s intercession. We refuse contempt even while we resist evil, and we leave room for enemies to become neighbors. Such forgiveness is not cheap; it costs pride, postpones vindication, and demands trust that God will judge rightly.</p>
<p>“They know not” is not an alibi; it is diagnosis. People trapped inside bad stories act like it. The antidote is revelation—evidence about God’s character strong enough to break the spell. Calvary supplies that evidence. Here is what the Father is like: giving Himself at the place we expected Him to give us up. If that reality takes root, history changes trajectories and hearts reorder their loyalties.</p>
<p>We finish this section where it began: with a voice speaking better than ours from a place lower than ours. The word “Father” anchors the plea in relationship unbroken by our cruelty. The word “forgive” opens a future none of us could manufacture. Between them stands the One who bridges heaven and earth by bearing the weight of our ignorance and offering us light. The prayer still covers the world—and us.</p>
