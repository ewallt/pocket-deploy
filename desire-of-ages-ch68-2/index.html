<header class="h"><h1>The Greeks Desire to See Jesus — Part 2: “The Hour Has Come”</h1><p class="intro">Jesus names His moment and explains its logic: glory through surrender, life through death, many through One.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Triggered by the Greeks’ request, Jesus declares what the Gospel has been pacing toward: “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.” Glory here is not applause but radiance revealed at Calvary. He reaches for an agrarian parable to disarm our instincts. A grain kept safe remains alone; a grain surrendered multiplies. The kingdom’s arithmetic runs on relinquishment. What looks like loss is harvest in disguise, because love’s nature is to give itself and thus to give life.</p>
<p>This hour is costly. “Now is my soul troubled.” The honesty matters. Jesus does not romanticize suffering or glorify pain; He submits to a purpose that will heal the world. The prayer He models is not escape but alignment: “Father, glorify Thy name.” In answer, a voice affirms from heaven—a public sign that the path is not madness but mission. The crowd debates thunder or angel; disciples learn to trust affirmation even when bystanders mishear.</p>
<p>The teaching turns from His surrender to ours. “He who loves his life loses it … he who hates his life in this world will keep it.” This is not self-loathing; it is a decisive refusal to enthrone the self. To follow Him is to de-center survival and re-center love. “Where I am, there will my servant be also”—near need, near sorrow, near the cross. The promise attached is tender and bracing: “If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.” Heaven’s honor system inverts earth’s.</p>
<p>Jesus frames the hour as verdict on the cosmos. “Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.” The cross unmasks the dark logic that has governed us—fear, accusation, domination—and strips it of moral credibility. Evil is not merely restrained; it is exposed and discredited by a goodness willing to suffer rather than coerce. Judgment, in this sense, is revelation that frees captives to choose light without illusion.</p>
<p>Finally, He announces the magnet of the ages: “And I, when I am lifted up … will draw all men to myself.” Lifted up means crucified, then exalted. The draw is universal in scope, particular in invitation. Every tribe and temperament will find themselves summoned by the sight of a Love that will not let go. The Greeks asked to see; the world will be shown. The cross will stand where no passport is required and no court divides.</p>
<p>To live inside this hour is to trade strategies for faithfulness. We sow ourselves like seeds—into neighborhoods, vocations, friendships—trusting the Spirit with outcomes. We measure success by fruit that blesses others, not by the safety of our shells. And when the soul is troubled, we borrow His prayer. Father, glorify Your name—in us, through us, at whatever cost heals the people You love.</p>
