      "title": "The Battle for Electrical Supremacy",
      "introduction": "In the late 19th century, the world stood on the brink of an electrical revolution. As cities grew and industries boomed, the demand for electric light and power created a monumental opportunity. Two competing technologies emerged to meet this demand, championed by two titans of invention, leading to a fierce public and technical battle known as the 'War of the Currents'.",

          "title": "The Central Problem: Power at a Distance",
          "content": "The primary challenge was transmitting electrical power from a generator to homes and factories miles away without significant power loss. The existing standard, Direct Current (DC), was inefficient over long distances, requiring power plants to be located every square mile."

        {
          "title": "Two Competing Visions",
          "content": "<strong>Thomas Edison</strong> defended his established Direct Current (DC) system, which was safe at low voltages but impractical for broad distribution. <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> championed a new system, Alternating Current (AC), which could be easily 'stepped up' to high voltages for efficient long-distance travel and then 'stepped down' for safe consumer use."

          "content": "The victor would not only reap enormous financial rewards but would also determine the very shape of the modern electrical grid, influencing the development of society for the next century. The battle involved scientific debate, corporate espionage, and a dramatic public relations campaign."

      "bio": "A prolific American inventor and astute businessman, Thomas Edison held over 1,000 patents and is credited with developing many devices that greatly influenced life around the world. His promotion of Direct Current (DC) established the first electrical utilities, but his insistence on its superiority led him into direct conflict with Tesla's more efficient AC system.",

          "title": "Direct Current (DC)",
          "content": "Edison's system was built on DC, where electricity flows in one constant direction. It was effective for his incandescent light bulb and early motors, but its low voltage made it suffer from significant power loss over distance, limiting its range."

        {
          "title": "The Power of the System",
          "content": "Edison's true genius was in creating a complete, commercially viable <em>system</em>: the generator (dynamo), the wiring, the fuse, and the light bulb itself. This created a powerful, entrenched infrastructure that was difficult to challenge."

        {
          "title": "Pragmatic, Market-Driven Invention",
          "content": "Edison was a master of iterative development and practical application. His focus was on creating commercially successful products. This led him to defend his existing, profitable DC system fiercely against the disruptive potential of AC."

          "title": "The Anti-AC Campaign",
          "content": "To combat the rise of AC, Edison launched a public relations campaign to portray it as dangerously unsafe. This campaign involved public demonstrations where animals were electrocuted using AC, and lobbying to make 'Westinghoused' (after Tesla's corporate partner) a term for execution by electric chair."
