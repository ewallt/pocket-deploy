<header class="h"><h1>Newton’s Principia</h1><p>The laws that bound Earth and sky in one grand system.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Isaac Newton’s *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (1687) unified the fragmented advances of a century into a single framework. Where Copernicus displaced Earth, Galileo measured motion, and Kepler quantified orbits, Newton fused them with calculus and force.</p>
<p>His three laws of motion provided a grammar of dynamics: inertia, acceleration by force, and equal reaction. From them he derived the inverse-square law of universal gravitation—an audacious claim that the same force pulling an apple earthward keeps the Moon in its path.</p>
<p>With this synthesis, the heavens ceased to be special. The cosmos obeyed the same principles everywhere, describable by equations rather than essences. The universe became a system—predictable, mechanical, and elegantly simple.</p>
<p>Newton’s reasoning linked geometry and experiment with unprecedented precision. By comparing lunar motion and terrestrial gravity, he confirmed that weight was a measure of universal attraction. Nature’s diversity yielded to a unity of law.</p>
<p>The *Principia* also reshaped philosophy. It offered a model of explanation grounded not in causes but in mathematical relations. Newton “feigned no hypotheses” beyond what equations required, establishing the empirical humility that would guide modern science.</p>
<p>Its impact was immediate and enduring. Within decades, engineers predicted tides, built stable bridges, and charted planetary perturbations using Newtonian mechanics. The clockwork universe had been born—a cosmos governed by reason yet still, in Newton’s view, maintained by divine order.</p>
<p>By weaving together motion, mass, and mathematics, Newton closed the circle begun by Copernicus. The Scientific Revolution had reached its synthesis: the cosmos as a lawful creation open to the human mind.</p>
