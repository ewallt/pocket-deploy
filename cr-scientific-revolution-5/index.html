<header class="h"><h1>The Enlightenment Legacy</h1><p>Reason, nature, and the confidence that knowledge could improve the world.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>When Newton’s *Principia* appeared, it did more than explain motion—it modeled a new way of knowing. The Enlightenment inherited not just formulas but faith in human reason to uncover order everywhere: in government, economy, and mind itself.</p>
<p>Thinkers such as Locke, Voltaire, and Diderot translated Newton’s cosmic harmony into social philosophy. If nature was governed by laws, perhaps society was too. Rational inquiry became both moral duty and political hope.</p>
<p>Science, once a monastic pursuit, became public enterprise. Academies, journals, and coffeehouses multiplied; experiment replaced authority as arbiter of truth. The method born of stargazers now guided physicians, engineers, and economists.</p>
<p>Yet the mechanistic worldview also carried tension. By turning nature into clockwork, it risked banishing purpose and mystery. Philosophers wrestled with reconciling freedom and determinism, spirit and mechanism—a dialogue that still shapes modern thought.</p>
<p>The revolution’s legacy was double-edged: it freed minds from dogma but tempted them toward hubris. Enlightenment optimism produced progress and empire alike, scientific medicine and industrial exploitation.</p>
<p>Still, its central conviction endures—that understanding the world through reason and evidence ennobles the human spirit. The telescope, the equation, and the experiment became symbols of dignity as well as discovery.</p>
<p>From Copernicus to Newton, the Scientific Revolution transformed not just knowledge but the meaning of knowledge: truth as something pursued, tested, and shared. Its light continues to travel, still illuminating the path of inquiry centuries later.</p>
