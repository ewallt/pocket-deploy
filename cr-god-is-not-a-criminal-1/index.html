<header class="h"><h1>The Safe Power</h1><p class="intro">*The rod is harmless while held in the hand of God.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Before the drama of the plagues, God gave Moses a sign. A rod cast to the ground became a serpent, then became a rod again when taken up. The sign was more than spectacle — it was theology in miniature. Power is safe only while in God’s grasp. The moment it is released from His control, it becomes a threat.</p>
<p>That rod symbolized all the forces of creation and authority. In His hand they sustain life; outside His hand they destroy. The transformation was God’s visual lesson on how the universe works: order depends entirely on relationship with its Source.</p>
<p>This truth explains every judgment story that follows. God’s actions in Egypt were not outbreaks of temper but the outworking of separation. When Pharaoh rejected divine authority, he loosed the serpent forces of chaos upon himself.</p>
<p>Power itself is not evil. It is morally defined by the character that wields it. In God, power serves love; in rebellion, power serves self. This is the foundation for understanding why the Almighty can never be a criminal.</p>
<p>The first step toward that understanding is to see that the safest place for any power — natural, political, or spiritual — is still in the hand of God.</p>
