    <h1>Proof and Reception</h1>
    <p>How experiments and skeptical minds turned radical theory into established reality.</p>
  </header>
  <section class="p">
    <p>Einstein’s 1905 papers made bold claims that demanded verification. Theories can dazzle on paper, but physics demands contact with measurement. Within a few years, experiments across Europe and the United States began probing his ideas—some inadvertently, some deliberately—and the evidence began to cohere around them.</p>
    <p>The photoelectric effect, at first a curiosity in Hertz’s lab, gained clarity through Robert Millikan’s decade-long precision work. Though Millikan set out to refute Einstein’s light quanta, his apparatus—carefully polished zinc plates, vacuum tubes, calibrated voltages—confirmed the linear relation between photon energy and electron kinetic energy. His 1916 data matched Einstein’s equation perfectly, compelling him to accept the result while still struggling with its conceptual implications.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Jean Perrin’s optical observations of Brownian motion continued to vindicate atomic theory. Using a microscope and ingenious tracking techniques, Perrin derived Avogadro’s number from colloid particle displacements and compared it with values from electrolysis and gas kinetics. The agreement across domains was decisive: the atom ceased to be hypothetical and became a counted entity, transforming chemistry and thermodynamics alike.</p>
    <p>Relativity’s road to acceptance was more gradual. The Michelson–Morley experiment, performed before Einstein’s paper, had already failed to detect any ether drift. Einstein’s reinterpretation made that null result not an embarrassment but a triumph of principle. Subsequent refinements by Kennedy and Thorndike reinforced that light’s speed is invariant regardless of the observer’s motion.</p>
    <p>By 1911, experiments with fast electrons and time-dilated radioactive decays hinted that the Lorentz transformations captured real effects, not mere mathematical convenience. The famous 1919 Eddington expedition would later elevate Einstein to celebrity with general relativity, but the groundwork of credibility had been laid by those earlier confirmations of the special theory.</p>
    <p>Intellectually, the community’s conversion was uneven. Some elders dismissed relativity as “Einstein’s mathematics,” while younger physicists found liberation in its clarity. Planck championed the work early, seeing in it a rare synthesis of logic and observation. By the First World War, relativity and the quantum hypothesis had become essential pillars—uneasy neighbors in need of reconciliation, but no longer fringe notions.</p>
    <p>Einstein watched this acceptance with mixed feelings. He valued confirmation but distrusted premature institutionalization. For him, the point was not fame or orthodoxy but understanding. Each successful test, he said, only brought physics a little closer to reality’s inner harmony, a melody still partly out of reach.</p>
