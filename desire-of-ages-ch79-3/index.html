<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 3: Law, Justice, and Mercy Vindicated</h1><p class="intro">Calvary answers the charges: the law stands, justice is real, mercy is offered, and God remains Himself.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Satan’s brief is sharp: the law cannot be kept; justice and mercy are incompatible; pardon would weaken government; sinners cannot be safely restored. The chapter answers by pointing at the cross. Here is law honored—not relaxed—because God does not change His standard; He gives Himself in Christ for those who broke it. Here is justice satisfied—not sidelined—because sin’s wages fall on a willing Substitute. Here is mercy flowing—not cheaply—but on a foundation that will keep the universe secure.</p>
<p>The immutability of the law matters. Were the standard adjusted, rebellion would be confirmed as wisdom and holiness would turn opportunist. Instead, Calvary reveals that the law is the transcript of God’s character—truthful, loving, free—and therefore cannot be altered without unmaking reality. That is why the cost is what it is: only self-giving at this depth could both reveal the law’s righteousness and open a door for the lawbreaker’s return. Justice remains believable; mercy becomes beautiful.</p>
<p>This vindication is not abstract. It shows in the way Jesus dies—without bitterness, without deceit, refusing to trade methods with His enemies. If a single sin had been uncovered in Him, the adversary would have triumphed. But every test only clarified His sinlessness, and His spotless life became the acceptable offering. The government that asks for righteousness has not asked what it is unwilling to provide; it has displayed righteousness embodied, then sacrificed, to make our pardon just.</p>
<p>In this light, forgiveness is neither indulgence nor delay of sentence. It is God’s truthful welcome on the basis of a finished work that did not bend the rules but fulfilled them. The repentant are not smuggled past justice; they are united to the One who has honored it and exhausted its claim against them. The moral universe remains coherent. The invitation is wide because the foundation is solid.</p>
<p>Communities that believe this will teach both gravity and gladness. They will preach the law without weaponizing it and the gospel without thinning it. They will expect transformed lives not because human resolve has improved but because the cross has secured both pardon and power. And they will refuse the old slander that pits the Father’s justice against the Son’s mercy; Calvary reveals a single heart.</p>
<p>Thus, part three stands where the chapter stands: God’s character and government are vindicated at the very place where sinners are forgiven. The door we walk through is the same door that keeps the universe safe.</p>
