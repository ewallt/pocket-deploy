<header class="h"><h1>“It Is Finished” — Part 3: The Veil Torn, The Way Open</h1><p class="intro">From sanctuary to street, signs interpret the shout: access opened, symbols fulfilled, distance ended.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The evangelists record that at Jesus’ death the temple veil was torn from top to bottom. The detail insists on direction: not earth clawing toward heaven, but heaven opening toward earth. The barrier before the Most Holy place—thick, heavy, meant to signal separation—yields to a hand unseen. What centuries of sacrifices could only foreshadow now arrives in substance. The God who drew near in tent and temple throws the door wide in His Son.</p>
<p>This is not an attack on worship; it is worship fulfilled. The priesthood’s daily traffic of blood and incense had been a tutoring system in mercy. Now the Tutor stands before us, lesson complete. We do not discard reverence; we relocate it from curtain to Christ. Repentance and faith become the appointed path across the torn threshold—no fee, no human gatekeeper, no pedigree required.</p>
<p>The tear also judges our economies of exclusion. Where we erected layers of privilege—court within court, rank within rank—God’s act runs the other way. Access ceases to be a scarce resource. Gentiles, women, servants, thieves who pray mid-sentence: all find the same line of sight. The veil was a symbol; our substitutes are habits. The gospel pulls at both until prayer becomes a public right for the world.</p>
<p>Inside, priests feel the wind of a Presence no longer confined. Outside, a centurion watches how Jesus dies and confesses, “Truly this was the Son of God.” The two spheres meet in their own ways—liturgy shaken awake; empire surprised by holiness. The signs are God’s commentary on the cry. Finished work does not shrink the sacred; it spreads it, consecrating ordinary space for communion.</p>
<p>For conscience, the torn veil means we come near without theatrical bravado or timid detours. We confess, not because we fear a lash behind the curtain, but because Love has stepped through it to meet us. We intercede with boldness for enemies and with patience for ourselves. When shame hisses that we do not belong, the rent fabric answers louder than our memories do.</p>
<p>Communities that take this sign seriously will design pathways not choke points. They will make prayer small enough for beginners and deep enough for the old. They will receive prodigals without probation and teach saints to kneel without superiority. The veil is gone. The way is open. The invitation is for all who will come.</p>
