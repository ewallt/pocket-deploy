<section class="p">
<p>The end of the controversy is not the end of freedom; it is its security. When the family of creation fully understands God’s character, allegiance is no longer precarious. Trust becomes the stable center of communal life, and worship becomes the glad recognition of reality.</p>
<p>In such a universe, law is simply love described. Obedience is not bargaining for favor but participation in the wisdom that sustains existence. Holiness is the beauty of relationships aligned with the Lamb.</p>
<p>Judgment, too, is transformed in memory. Once feared as threat, it is remembered as the moment clarity arrived. The scars of Christ forever interpret authority: the One who reigns bears the cost of our safety in His own body.</p>
<p>The fruit is culture: homes marked by patience, nations tempered by justice, churches practicing truthful mercy. Where God is known this way, coercion loses its glamor and violence its credibility.</p>
<p>Eternity opens as an ever-deepening education in love. The cross remains the curriculum, the resurrection the guarantee, and the Spirit the teacher. In this light, the universe is not merely preserved; it is healed, harmonized, and set joyfully free.</p>
