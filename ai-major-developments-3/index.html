<header class="h"><h1>Learning Machines and Cybernetics — Part 3</h1><p class="intro">No, early AI did not rely only on rules; a parallel tradition pursued learning, feedback, and adaptation as the essence of intelligence.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Cybernetics framed intelligence as control through communication and feedback, asking how systems stabilize themselves amid noise. Wiener’s mathematics of feedback loops, Shannon’s information theory, and McCulloch–Pitts neurons suggested that mindlike behavior could emerge from networks and signals rather than hand-written rules. This changed the question: not “What rules define thought?” but “What mechanisms allow systems to learn better rules over time?”</p>
<p>Perceptrons offered a concrete learning machine. With trainable weights, they categorized inputs by adjusting a boundary through experience. Minsky and Papert later exposed their limits—single-layer perceptrons could not capture XOR—yet the episode clarified the deeper need for multilayer representations and credit assignment across depth. The critique slowed neural enthusiasm while sharpening its future.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning developed alongside, inspired by behaviorist psychology and optimal control. Agents learned by trial and error, receiving scalar rewards rather than labeled answers. Dynamic programming and temporal-difference methods offered a way to bootstrap value from experience, building long-horizon competence through incremental updates. Learning became a dialog between exploration and estimation.</p>
<p>Another strand—Hebbian learning—argued that connection strengths should reflect co-activation, encoding statistical structure of the world in synapses. Stochastic gradient descent later unified many of these intuitions, treating learning as iterative optimization. The mathematics of generalization, bias-variance tradeoffs, and regularization gradually reframed “intelligence” as data-driven approximation under constraints.</p>
<p>Compared to symbolic AI, cybernetics emphasized signals over symbols, adaptation over deduction, and prediction over proof. The two traditions solved different problems: rules reasoned well in narrow, clean domains, while learning systems coped better with noise, novelty, and perception. Their rivalry became most productive where they met—planning with learned models, or logic guided by learned priors.</p>
<p>In synthesis, early learning and cybernetics supplied the grammar of adaptation: objective signals, update rules, and architectures that improve with experience. Later breakthroughs would depend on scale and depth, but the conceptual move—treating intelligence as a learning process—was already in place, waiting for data, compute, and algorithms to catch up.</p>
