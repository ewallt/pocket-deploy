<section class="p">
<p>Scripture names God “a consuming fire,” yet the same fire lights the bush that burned and was not consumed. The difference is not in the flame but in the material. Love is the atmosphere of heaven; sin is combustible. Every being will meet that flame, and its effect will tell the truth about what we have become.</p>
<p>The prophets never pictured God stockpiling external fuel. His judgments arise from His nearness, not His distance. To the pure in heart, that nearness is warmth and glory. To the unyielding, it is exposure—truth arriving faster than self-deception can hide.</p>
<p>Divine wrath, then, is not God turning against us but reality catching up with us. His holiness reveals what cannot live in love’s environment. That revelation feels like fire because it consumes illusion. Grace offers cleansing first so that encounter can become communion, not destruction.</p>
<p>From Eden’s guarded way to Sinai’s thunder to Pentecost’s tongues, the story remains: God draws near in flame, testing the quality of every life. Nothing impure survives the intimacy of infinite goodness—and that is our hope, not our terror.</p>
<p>We cannot escape the fire, but we can learn to live within it. Its purpose is not to annihilate creation but to make it real. What burns is falsehood; what remains is freedom.</p>
