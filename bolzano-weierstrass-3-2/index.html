      <p class="lead">Part 2 · Heine–Borel Theorem</p>

      <article>
        <p>The Heine–Borel theorem crystallizes compactness on the real line: a subset of ℝ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. In practical terms, any open cover of a closed, bounded set admits a finite subcover. This result elevates the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem from a sequential guarantee to a geometric statement about covering spaces with open intervals.</p>

        <p>To prove the theorem, we typically start with a closed interval \([a,b]\). Suppose it is covered by open intervals. If no finite subcover exists, we split \([a,b]\) into halves and observe that at least one half cannot be finitely covered either. Continuing this bisection yields a nested sequence of closed intervals whose lengths shrink to zero. Completeness ensures their intersection contains a point \(x\), but since the original open cover blankets \([a,b]\), the point \(x\) lies inside some open interval. That interval covers a neighborhood of \(x\), allowing us to backtrack and build a finite subcover—a contradiction. Hence the original cover must admit a finite subcover.</p>

        <p>The forward implication—compact implies closed and bounded—also relies on completeness. Compact sets cannot escape to infinity (hence bounded) and must contain their limit points (hence closed). Sequential compactness and the Heine–Borel theorem align: from an open cover, we build sequences that would contradict Bolzano–Weierstrass if the set were not closed, and from unboundedness we manufacture sequences without convergent subsequences.</p>

        <p>Heine–Borel’s conceptual payoff is enormous. It allows us to translate between covers, sequences, and continuity arguments seamlessly. For instance, the extreme value theorem and uniform continuity on closed intervals become immediate corollaries because continuous images of compact sets remain compact, and compact subsets of ℝ are automatically bounded and closed.</p>

        <p>The theorem also foreshadows general topology. In arbitrary metric spaces, compactness need not coincide with closed and bounded. However, the Heine–Borel property characterizes Euclidean spaces: a subset of ℝⁿ is compact exactly when it is closed and bounded. This bridge motivates the study of total boundedness and completeness in more abstract settings.</p>

        <p>Armed with the cover-based viewpoint, we can appreciate sequential compactness anew. The next article explains how Bolzano–Weierstrass generalizes in metric spaces and why sequential compactness, compactness, and completeness intertwine in rich ways.</p>
