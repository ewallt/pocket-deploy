      <p class="lead">Part 2 · Heine–Borel Theorem</p>

      <article>
        <p>The Heine–Borel theorem proclaims that a subset of \(\mathbb{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Compactness, defined via open covers admitting finite subcovers, looks abstract at first glance. Yet Heine–Borel translates this topological notion into the concrete language of intervals, making it the natural sequel to Bolzano–Weierstrass. Closed and bounded intervals already host every bounded sequence’s convergent subsequences; Heine–Borel tells us the same sets tame open covers as well.</p>

        <p>To appreciate the finite subcover property, imagine covering \([a,b]\) with a collection of open intervals \((U_i)_{i\in I}\). Even if the cover is infinite, Heine–Borel guarantees that finitely many of the \(U_i\) suffice. The usual proof mirrors the nested-interval argument: assume no finite subcover exists, then construct a binary subdivision \([a,b] = I_0\). Because \(I_0\) lacks a finite subcover, at least one half also lacks one; continue bisecting to obtain a nested sequence of intervals whose lengths approach zero. Completeness ensures the intersection contains a point \(x\) not covered by any finite subcollection, contradicting the original cover.</p>

        <p>The closedness condition is crucial. Open intervals like \((0,1)\) are bounded but not compact: the open cover \{\((0,1-1/n)) : n \ge 2\)\} lacks a finite subcover because every finite selection misses a neighborhood near 1. Similarly, unbounded sets like \([0,\infty)\) fail compactness because we can cover them with intervals whose endpoints march to infinity without ever finishing the job. Closed and bounded together precisely prevent these pathologies.</p>

        <p>Heine–Borel illustrates the deep synergy between sequential and open-cover notions of compactness. In \(\mathbb{R}\), Bolzano–Weierstrass (sequential compactness) and Heine–Borel (open-cover compactness) are equivalent. This equivalence foreshadows the general metric-space result proved later in the series. For now, it highlights how subsequence arguments and cover arguments reflect the same underlying completeness.</p>

        <p>The theorem’s reach extends to analysis applications: it underpins the Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity results, and convergence properties of series. Whenever you see a proof that extracts a finite subcollection from an infinite family on \([a,b]\), you are witnessing Heine–Borel in action. Recognizing compactness in disguise becomes a powerful problem-solving instinct.</p>

        <p>Next we shift from intervals to metric spaces, showing that sequential compactness equals compactness in that broader setting. The Heine–Borel intuition will accompany us, guiding how we generalize covers and subsequences beyond the real line.</p>
