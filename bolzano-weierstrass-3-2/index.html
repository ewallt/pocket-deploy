<header class="h"><h1>Heine–Borel Theorem</h1><p class="intro">Compact sets as closed and bounded, open covers, and the finite subcover property.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Compactness is one of the most powerful concepts in analysis, and the Heine–Borel Theorem characterizes it in Euclidean space: a subset of ℝⁿ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. In ℝ, compact sets are precisely the closed intervals [a, b] and finite unions thereof, along with other closed bounded sets. Compactness captures the idea that a set is "small enough" to force good behavior—continuous functions attain maxima, sequences have convergent subsequences, and covers can be reduced to finite subcovers. BWT is intimately connected to compactness: it is the sequential form of compactness for ℝ.</p>
<p>The topological definition of compactness: a set K is compact if every open cover of K has a finite subcover. An open cover is a collection of open sets whose union contains K. If you can always extract a finite subcollection still covering K, then K is compact. This property seems abstract, but it encodes "finiteness" in disguise—infinite collections of open sets can be tamed to finite ones. In ℝ, Heine–Borel says this topological property is equivalent to the simple metric condition: closed and bounded. This equivalence makes compactness checkable and powerful.</p>
<p>Closed and bounded are both necessary. Boundedness alone isn't enough: (0, 1) is bounded but not compact—the open cover {(1/n, 1)} for n ≥ 2 has no finite subcover. Closedness alone isn't enough: [0, ∞) is closed but unbounded, and the cover {(−1, n)} for n ∈ ℕ has no finite subcover. Combining the two conditions—closed to capture boundary limit points, bounded to prevent escape to infinity—yields compactness. Heine–Borel makes this precise: in ℝⁿ, closed + bounded ⟺ compact. This characterization is special to Euclidean spaces; in general metric spaces, closed and bounded doesn't imply compact, but ℝⁿ's structure makes it work.</p>
<p>BWT is equivalent to sequential compactness in ℝ: a set is sequentially compact if every sequence in the set has a subsequence converging to a point in the set. For subsets of ℝ, sequential compactness coincides with compactness (finite subcover property). BWT applied to sequences in a closed bounded set [a, b] says: take any sequence in [a, b]; it's bounded, so it has a convergent subsequence by BWT; the subsequence converges to some limit, and because [a, b] is closed, the limit lies in [a, b]. Thus [a, b] is sequentially compact. Conversely, sequential compactness implies closed and bounded. BWT and Heine–Borel are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>The proof of Heine–Borel uses BWT or related ideas. One direction: assume K is closed and bounded in ℝ. Take an open cover. If no finite subcover exists, construct a sequence in K avoiding all finite subcovers in a clever way (often by bisection or contradiction). BWT yields a convergent subsequence; the limit lies in K (closedness). The limit belongs to some open set in the cover, which contains a neighborhood, eventually capturing infinitely many terms—contradicting the construction. Hence a finite subcover must exist. The other direction uses contrapositive: if not closed or not bounded, exhibit an open cover with no finite subcover. The details reveal how compactness, closedness, boundedness, and convergent subsequences interlock in ℝ.</p>
<p>Heine–Borel and BWT together provide the sequential and covering perspectives on compactness in ℝ. Compact sets are exactly those where sequences can't escape (sequential compactness via BWT) and where open covers can't spread infinitely (finite subcover property via Heine–Borel). This duality is central to analysis: compactness guarantees extrema (EVT), uniform continuity (Heine–Cantor), and many existence results. BWT is the sequential manifestation of compactness, making it concrete and accessible, while Heine–Borel is the topological characterization, making it general and powerful. Understanding both is key to mastering real analysis.</p>
