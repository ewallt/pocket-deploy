<p>The story begins with a gentle father whose convictions are settled—he will not hunt. Taking life violates what he knows of goodness. Yet his son grows enamored with the craft and resolves to take up the rifle. Counsel fails. Appeals fall flat. A decision must be made: cut the boy off, or stay close enough to save.</p>
<p>He chooses presence over purity of appearance. If he walks away, the boy learns alone, endangering himself and others. If he stays, the father can teach safety, restraint, and reverence for life—even while grieving the choice itself. The father’s heart has not changed; the situation has.</p>
<p>Accommodation is not endorsement. It is the humility of love working within limits freely chosen by another. It leverages the relationship that remains to minimize harm and keep the door open for repentance. The father will carry the cost of being misread if it means his son might live.</p>
<p>This is a window into God’s way with us. When humanity insists on paths God does not approve, He does not abandon the world to ignorance. He remains, guiding as far as we will let Him, guarding where we make room, and grieving where we will not.</p>
<p>Thus the parable sets the frame: the God who refuses coercion will also refuse abandonment. Love prefers the risk of being misunderstood to the certainty of losing a child.</p>
