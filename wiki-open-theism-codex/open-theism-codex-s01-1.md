# Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets
**Part 1 · What is Open Theism?: Defining the Core View.**

Open theism is a theological proposal that contends God sovereignly grants genuine freedom to creatures, resulting in a future composed of both settled events and unfolding possibilities. The view insists that divine knowledge encompasses every reality that exists to be known, including determinate facts and branching potentialities. Rather than limiting God, proponents argue this dynamic omniscience magnifies divine wisdom and relational engagement, because God actively anticipates numerous potential responses within creation. Open theism therefore reframes providence as God’s interactive partnership with free agents, setting the stage for a more dialogical understanding of sovereignty.

Advocates typically summarize the position through several core affirmations. God is perfectly loving and relational, choosing to invite personal cooperation from creatures rather than unilaterally scripting every decision. Human agents possess libertarian freedom, meaning multiple courses of action are genuinely available at the moment of choice. The future is partly open, not because God lacks capacity, but because free decisions are not yet actual realities to be known exhaustively. Finally, divine omniscience is reconceived as knowledge of everything actual and possible, enabling God to skillfully adapt plans without compromising ultimate purposes.

The movement arose in late twentieth-century evangelicalism as pastors and philosophers sought explanations for unanswered prayer, suffering, and scriptural portrayals of divine responsiveness. They claimed that classical theism’s insistence on a wholly fixed future left little room for authentic interpersonal relationship between God and creatures. Instead, open theists emphasize biblical narratives depicting God deliberating, responding, or grieving in real time. These stories are interpreted not as anthropomorphic projections, but as disclosures of a God who genuinely engages with unfolding history. This interpretive stance provides a pastoral rationale for the model’s growth.

Open theism sharply distinguishes itself from process theology despite similarities in highlighting divine relationality. Process thought usually limits God’s power and asserts an eternal world, while open theists maintain creation ex nihilo and God’s ability to guarantee eschatological victory. They also affirm classical doctrines such as the Trinity, resurrection, and final judgment. The divergence lies primarily in claims about the ontological status of future free choices. For open theists, those choices lack present truth value precisely because they do not yet exist; thus God’s comprehensive knowledge rightly includes them as possibilities rather than certainties.

A recurring criticism suggests that limiting foreknowledge diminishes divine perfection. Open theists respond by redefining perfection in light of covenantal faithfulness and interactive wisdom. They contend that knowing possibilities is not ignorance, but an accurate grasp of a reality that is partly indeterminate. God’s confidence in achieving purposes stems from infinite resourcefulness, not from a frozen script. Consequently, the model portrays God as the most competent strategist imaginable, one who can navigate open futures better than a general commanding an army through unpredictable terrain.

The model’s relational emphasis extends to prayer and guidance. Open theists assert that petitions can meaningfully influence divine action because God has left certain outcomes undecided. Petitionary prayer becomes a collaborative endeavor where God invites participation in shaping history. Likewise, providential guidance involves God offering wisdom and nudges while respecting human agency. This outlook nurtures a spirituality attentive to discernment, trusting that God responds to choices with new invitations rather than coercive overrides. The relationship becomes a dynamic conversation sustained by mutual fidelity.

Ultimately, open theism presents itself as a reform movement within evangelical theology, aiming to reconcile God’s exhaustive love with authentic creaturely freedom. It claims fidelity to the biblical witness, pastoral coherence in the face of suffering, and philosophical plausibility regarding contingency. Whether one finds the arguments persuasive, the model seeks to honor God as living, responsive, and inventive. Understanding these foundational convictions prepares readers for deeper investigations into foreknowledge, providence, and the scriptural debates that follow throughout this library.
