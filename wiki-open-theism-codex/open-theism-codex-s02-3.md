# Open Theism: Scriptural Basis, History, and Key Debates
**Part 3 · Key New Testament Texts: Divine Knowledge and Human Agency.**

New Testament passages addressing divine knowledge and human freedom fuel ongoing debate between open and classical theists. Open theists point to texts emphasizing contingency and relational prayer. In the Gospels, Jesus marvels at unexpected faith, laments over Jerusalem’s resistance, and teaches disciples to pray for God’s will to be done on earth. These narratives depict a ministry shaped by genuine responses rather than predetermined scripts. The kingdom advances through invitations and warnings, suggesting that human agency significantly influences the unfolding story of redemption.

Acts provides additional evidence. In Acts 15, the Jerusalem Council deliberates over Gentile inclusion, concluding with the phrase “it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.” The decision emerges through testimony, debate, and communal discernment rather than direct revelation of a predetermined plan. Similarly, Paul’s missionary journeys involve course corrections prompted by the Spirit, human opposition, or strategic judgment. Open theists argue that such narratives illustrate God guiding in real time, honoring the decisions of apostles while redirecting as necessary.

Passages about prayer also support an open future. Jesus encourages persistent petition in Luke 11 and 18, promising that God will respond to those who ask, seek, and knock. James 5 declares that the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective, citing Elijah’s intercession that altered rainfall patterns. Open theists contend that these teachings lose force if outcomes are fixed. Instead, they reveal a God who eagerly involves believers in shaping history through prayerful partnership, reinforcing the relational nature of divine governance.

Opponents cite texts affirming God’s exhaustive foreknowledge, such as Romans 8:29-30 or Ephesians 1:4. Open theists interpret these passages as corporate promises about God’s salvific plan rather than detailed statements about every individual choice. They emphasize that the focus lies on God’s determination to conform believers to Christ, not on specifying each decision along the way. The open view asserts that God’s overarching intention is settled—those who love God will be glorified—while the path remains open to genuine cooperation or resistance.

Prophetic statements by Jesus, such as predicting Peter’s denial or the destruction of Jerusalem, are understood as instances where God has chosen to settle particular events. Open theists acknowledge that God can determine and therefore foreknow specific outcomes when necessary. These cases do not imply that every aspect of the future is fixed; rather, they demonstrate God’s ability to guarantee key redemptive milestones while still allowing many other details to remain contingent. The distinction aligns with the earlier discussion of unconditional versus conditional prophecy.

Revelation’s apocalyptic imagery also raises questions. Open theists generally affirm the ultimate victory of God and the final judgment while admitting uncertainty about the sequence of symbolic events. They advocate humility in interpreting apocalyptic timelines, noting that the visions aim to encourage faithfulness under persecution. The emphasis on conquering through witness suggests that believers’ choices matter in bringing about God’s purposes. The book’s dynamic interplay between divine sovereignty and human testimony resonates with an open future.

Overall, open theists claim that the New Testament portrays a responsive God who engages in genuine dialogue with humanity. By reading key passages through a relational lens, they maintain that divine knowledge is perfectly suited to a world containing free agents. God’s ultimate goals are secure, yet the journey invites authentic participation. This perspective sets the stage for examining historical developments and theological debates surrounding open theism.
