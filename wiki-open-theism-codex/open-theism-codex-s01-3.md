# Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets
**Part 3 · The Argument from Human Freedom: Does Determinism Conflict with Love?**

Open theists argue that genuine love requires the possibility of refusal. If God predetermined every human decision, then expressions of devotion, trust, or obedience would be scripted inevitabilities rather than authentic responses. The model therefore insists that libertarian freedom—having alternative possibilities at the moment of choice—is necessary for meaningful relationship. While compatibilists claim that love can coexist with determinism, open theists counter that coerced affection lacks moral significance. The biblical portrait of covenant partnership, they assert, presupposes that humans can either embrace or resist God’s invitations.

This argument draws on relational analogies. Consider a friendship maintained through mutual vulnerability and unpredictable generosity. Such intimacy would collapse if one party secretly orchestrated the other’s every move. Open theists extend this intuition to divine-human communion. God values reciprocal trust so highly that God voluntarily limits unilateral control, preferring responsive love over mechanical compliance. This choice reflects divine self-giving character: sovereignty is expressed through empowering others, not through deterministic micromanagement. Accordingly, the risk of rejection is integral to the drama of redemption.

Philosophically, open theists critique theological determinism for undermining moral responsibility. If every action unfolds according to a fixed decree, then blame and praise appear hollow. The open view maintains that accountability presupposes the ability to do otherwise. Scriptural calls to repent, choose life, or resist temptation resonate because the future is not irrevocably scripted. God’s judgments are just precisely because they respond to authentic decisions. This perspective aims to preserve the seriousness of sin and the dignity of obedience within the narrative of salvation history.

Determinists often reply that divine foreknowledge does not entail causal necessity. They argue that God knows future free choices without causing them. Open theists respond that certainty about future contingents effectively collapses freedom into inevitability. If God infallibly knows that Peter will deny Christ tonight, Peter cannot refrain without falsifying God’s knowledge. To avoid this contradiction, open theism reframes knowledge: God foreknows branching possibilities and their associated consequences, while the actual outcome remains unsettled until Peter acts. This preserves both omniscience and the integrity of human deliberation.

The love-centered argument also shapes theodicy. Open theists contend that much suffering results from creaturely misuse of freedom, not from meticulous divine planning. God grieves with victims, works to redeem tragedies, and ultimately promises restoration, yet does not will every calamity for a hidden purpose. This approach offers pastoral solace by portraying God as empathetic co-sufferer rather than remote architect of pain. It emphasizes that God’s power is expressed through redemptive resilience, bringing good out of chaos without having orchestrated the evil itself.

Prayer becomes a forum where love and freedom intersect. If outcomes are not predetermined, petitions can influence God’s responsive strategies. Open theists encourage believers to collaborate with God in shaping history through intercession, advocacy, and sacrificial service. The relational risk God embraces invites human partners to take responsibility for justice and reconciliation. Love thus manifests not only in emotional devotion but also in courageous participation in God’s mission to heal the world.

Ultimately, the argument from human freedom aims to defend divine love from deterministic interpretations that, in open theists’ view, make God the author of evil or render relationships illusory. By affirming libertarian freedom, the open model portrays God as deeply invested in authentic communion. The stakes are not merely philosophical; they touch the heart of Christian spirituality, where trust, repentance, and obedience are meaningful precisely because they could have been withheld.
