# Open Theism: Scriptural Basis, History, and Key Debates
**Part 2 · Key Old Testament Texts: Divine Relenting and Openness.**

Open theists draw significant support from Old Testament narratives in which God appears to change course. Genesis 6:6 portrays God grieving over human wickedness prior to the flood, expressing sorrow for creating humanity. Exodus 32 describes God relenting from destroying Israel after Moses intercedes. Jonah 3 recounts God sparing Nineveh when the city repents. These texts depict God as emotionally responsive and willing to adjust actions in light of human behavior. Open theists argue that reading them as mere anthropomorphisms diminishes their theological force and overlooks the relational depth they intend to convey.

Exodus 32:7-14 is especially pivotal. After Israel’s idolatry, God threatens annihilation, yet Moses pleads for mercy based on God’s reputation and promises. The narrative explicitly states that God “relented” and did not bring the threatened disaster. Open theists contend that this scene reveals genuine dialogue between God and an intercessor. Moses’ prayer matters because God has chosen to engage covenant partners meaningfully. The event underscores God’s commitment to relationship, demonstrating that divine plans incorporate human contribution rather than rendering it superfluous.

Similarly, Jonah’s mission illustrates conditional judgment. The prophet announces impending destruction, yet the people repent in sackcloth and ashes. God sees their change of heart and relents. Jonah’s frustration stems from his awareness of God’s compassion and readiness to adjust decisions. Open theists interpret the book as a theological treatise on divine mercy in an open future. The Nineveh episode shows that God’s threats aim to catalyze transformation, not to confirm a predetermined script. God’s responsiveness reveals steadfast love willing to forgive when sinners turn from violence.

Jeremiah 18 offers a metaphor that encapsulates open theism’s reading of providence. God likens divine action to a potter reworking clay when the vessel takes an unintended shape. The passage declares that God will reconsider announced judgments if nations repent and will withdraw promised blessing if they turn to evil. This imagery communicates flexibility grounded in moral governance. Open theists argue that the potter metaphor invites readers to see God as creatively adapting to human decisions while pursuing righteous ends. Divine sovereignty resides in the potter’s skill, not in forcing clay into a predetermined mold.

Other passages, such as 1 Samuel 15, where God regrets making Saul king, further complicate immutable conceptions of deity. The Hebrew term nacham conveys deep emotional movement. While the chapter also asserts that God is not like humans who change their minds, open theists interpret this as affirming God’s reliability, not negating the earlier expression of regret. God’s character remains constant even as actions shift in response to disobedience. This nuanced reading seeks to harmonize seemingly tension-filled statements within a relational framework.

Psalmic laments complement narrative texts by depicting worshipers appealing to God’s responsiveness. Psalmists implore God to remember, rise up, or relent, believing their petitions can alter circumstances. Open theists argue that such prayers presume an open future where divine compassion can be freshly expressed. The liturgical life of Israel thus reinforces the idea that God listens and acts within time, honoring the mutual commitments of covenant. Worship becomes a space where human vulnerability meets divine flexibility.

These Old Testament examples provide the backbone for open theism’s claim that scripture portrays a God who genuinely interacts with creation. By affirming divine relenting, regret, and responsive mercy, the texts invite believers to trust that their choices and prayers bear real weight. The open view therefore sees the Hebrew Bible as narrating a relational God whose unchanging love expresses itself through adaptable action.
