# Open Theism: Scriptural Basis, History, and Key Debates
**Part 5 · Open Theism vs. Classical Theism: Contrasting Views of God's Attributes.**

The debate between open and classical theism centers on differing portraits of God’s attributes. Classical theism typically affirms divine timelessness, immutability, impassibility, and exhaustive foreknowledge. Open theists maintain God’s omnipotence and omniscience but reinterpret these in relational terms. God experiences time, responds to creation, and knows the future as a range of possibilities when free decisions are involved. This reframing seeks to preserve the biblical emphasis on covenantal interaction. The contrast raises fundamental questions about how God’s perfection relates to relational change.

Regarding omniscience, classical theists claim God knows every future event infallibly. Open theists respond that the future partly consists of potentialities rather than certainties. Knowing possibilities does not entail ignorance; instead, it reflects the nature of reality God created. They argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with libertarian freedom. Classical theists counter that divine knowledge includes counterfactuals of creaturely freedom without eliminating contingency. The disagreement hinges on whether certainty about future choices undermines the ability to do otherwise.

Immutability presents another divergence. Traditional formulations depict God as unchanging in being, knowledge, and will. Open theists distinguish between God’s unchanging character and flexible strategies. God’s love, holiness, and purposes remain constant, yet God’s actions shift in response to prayer or rebellion. Critics worry this introduces instability or implies dependence on creation. Proponents answer that divine faithfulness is expressed precisely through responsiveness; God’s steadfast love compels adaptation to uphold covenant commitments amid evolving circumstances.

Divine impassibility—the notion that God does not experience emotional change—faces similar scrutiny. Open theists assert that scripture portrays God as grieving, rejoicing, and compassionately moved. They claim that genuine relationships require emotional involvement. Classical theists reinterpret such language as metaphorical accommodations protecting God’s transcendence. The open view insists that emotional reciprocity enhances rather than diminishes divine majesty, showcasing a God who willingly shares the joys and sorrows of creation.

The attribute of providence also diverges. Classical theism often emphasizes meticulous sovereignty, wherein every event unfolds according to a decretive plan. Open theists emphasize providence as wise, adaptive governance that invites creaturely collaboration. God’s power is expressed through persuasive love and resilient strategy rather than deterministic control. Critics fear this weakens assurance that God’s purposes will prevail. Open theists counter that God’s creative wisdom guarantees ultimate victory while respecting freedom, likening God to a master chess player capable of securing checkmate despite opponents’ unpredictable moves.

These contrasting attributes yield different spiritual emphases. Classical theism can foster awe at God’s transcendence and confidence in immutable decrees. Open theism cultivates a sense of partnership, highlighting the significance of prayer, moral choice, and communal discernment. Many believers find comfort in a God who shares their sorrows and adjusts plans to further love. Others prefer the stability of a God untouched by change. The debate ultimately invites the church to reflect on how best to integrate divine majesty with relational intimacy.

Open theists present their model as a faithful retrieval of biblical motifs that portray God as living, responsive, and deeply involved. Classical theists safeguard longstanding doctrinal formulations emphasizing divine simplicity and sovereignty. The ongoing conversation challenges theologians to articulate how God’s attributes relate to the open or settled nature of the future. Appreciating the contrasts clarifies the stakes of the debate and prepares us to examine contemporary critiques and implications in the next series.
