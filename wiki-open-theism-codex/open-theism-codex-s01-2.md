# Open Theism: Introduction and Core Tenets
**Part 2 · God, Time, and Foreknowledge: The Central Question.**

The debate over divine foreknowledge hinges on competing assumptions about the nature of time. Classical theists often embrace an eternalist view where past, present, and future exist simultaneously before God’s timeless gaze. Open theists instead adopt a dynamic or presentist model in which only the past and present are settled realities, while the future remains a realm of branching possibilities. If the future is ontologically open, then there simply are no definite truths about undetermined free choices. God’s perfect knowledge therefore consists in knowing the future as future, including its genuine contingencies.

Philosophers supporting open theism point to the logical problem of future contingents. Aristotle already noted that propositions about tomorrow’s sea battle cannot be presently true or false without undermining contingency. Open theists revive this insight, arguing that statements about undetermined human choices lack truth value until decisions occur. God, being omniscient, knows this semantic structure flawlessly. Divine knowledge comprehends every conditional pathway—what would happen if a person accepts or rejects a calling—without mistaking these possibilities for fixed certainties. The openness of the future thus reflects the openness of creaturely agency.

This temporal model reframes omniscience. Rather than envisioning a static ledger of future facts, open theists describe God holding an inexhaustible repertoire of conditional intentions. God might plan to accomplish purpose A if Israel cooperates and fallback to plan B if they resist, all while guaranteeing overarching covenant goals. Such adaptive wisdom requires no ignorance; it instead portrays God as supremely resourceful. Analogies from complex strategy games help illustrate the concept: a grandmaster does not predict a single sequence of moves but prepares for countless contingencies, responding creatively at each turn.

Critics worry that openness entails divine surprise. Open theists answer that surprise is compatible with sovereignty when grounded in infinite competence. God can encounter unexpected creaturely choices without being thwarted, because plans include resilient provisions for numerous outcomes. Scripture’s depictions of God regretting or relenting are therefore taken at face value: they reveal a God who genuinely experiences the unfolding of time with creation. Such experiences do not diminish deity; they highlight relational depth and the risk inherent in granting love-based freedom. The cross itself demonstrates divine willingness to absorb the cost of unpredictable creaturely rebellion.

Another implication concerns prophecy. If the future is partly open, how can God announce specific events? Open theists maintain that God can unilaterally determine certain outcomes while leaving others contingent. Prophecies may be unconditional declarations of what God will bring about regardless of human cooperation, or they may be conditional warnings whose fulfillment depends on response. Recognizing these categories allows open theism to affirm both the reliability of God’s promises and the flexibility embedded in prophetic literature. The central question becomes discerning which future segments God has chosen to settle.

The framework also influences pastoral care. Viewing time as dynamic encourages believers to treat choices as significant contributions to God’s story. Rather than fatalism, discipleship becomes participatory drama where prayer, repentance, and courageous action can shift trajectories. God’s foreknowledge does not render human effort perfunctory; instead, God’s foresight of possibilities invites collaboration. This stance energizes moral responsibility and hope, especially when navigating crises where outcomes seem uncertain yet open to redemptive transformation.

Ultimately, the question of God, time, and foreknowledge in open theism underscores a commitment to relational integrity. God’s knowledge is neither diminished nor static but finely attuned to the temporal structure of reality that divine love elected to create. Embracing an open future emphasizes that covenant faithfulness involves living, responsive companionship rather than inflexible control. Understanding this philosophical foundation equips readers to analyze subsequent arguments about freedom, providence, and scripture with greater precision.
