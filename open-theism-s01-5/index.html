<h1>Open Theism: Core Tenets and Philosophical Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 5 · Historical Precursors in Christian Thought</p>
<article>
<p>Though Open Theism emerged as a named movement in the late twentieth century, open theists identify historical precedents suggesting their view is not entirely novel. Calcidius, a fourth-century Christian Platonist, distinguished between things God knows with certainty and things that are uncertain. He suggested that outcomes depending on human free choice might not be determinate objects of knowledge even for God. While Calcidius remained a minor figure, his willingness to question exhaustive foreknowledge shows that the issue was recognized early in Christian thought. The challenge was generally resolved in favor of affirming divine foreknowledge, but the philosophical problems never entirely disappeared. Minority voices questioning exhaustive foreknowledge appear throughout church history, though they rarely gained prominence or developed into systematic theological positions.</p>

<p>The Socinians, a sixteenth and seventeenth-century anti-Trinitarian movement, developed views resembling aspects of Open Theism. Fausto Sozzini and his followers emphasized biblical texts depicting divine responsiveness and change, arguing that God knows all that exists but cannot know future contingents that do not yet exist. They rejected classical philosophical categories as Greek corruptions of biblical theology. The Socinians' denial of the Trinity and other heterodox views made them targets of persecution and meant their ideas were generally dismissed by orthodox Christians. However, their biblical argumentation regarding divine foreknowledge and their emphasis on libertarian free will anticipated Open Theist concerns. Whether there is direct historical influence or merely parallel development of similar ideas from similar scriptural starting points remains debated among scholars.</p>

<p>Arminian theology, developing from the work of Jacobus Arminius in the early seventeenth century, shares significant ground with Open Theism without embracing the denial of exhaustive foreknowledge. Arminians affirm libertarian free will and emphasize divine love and responsiveness over meticulous determinism. They maintain that God's foreknowledge does not cause events and that human freedom is real. However, classical Arminians affirm that God does possess exhaustive foreknowledge of all future events, including free choices. Some contemporary Arminians have moved toward Open Theism, recognizing that libertarian freedom sits uneasily with exhaustive foreknowledge. The question is whether Arminianism's affirmation of both creates internal tension that Open Theism resolves by denying foreknowledge of free choices. Critics of both views see the progression from Arminianism to Open Theism as a slippery slope; advocates see it as following premises to their logical conclusions.</p>

<p>Methodist theology, stemming from John Wesley's eighteenth-century revival movement, emphasized personal relationship with God, transformative religious experience, and the possibility of resisting divine grace. Wesley's Arminian commitments and his pastoral emphasis on prayer and sanctification created theological space for later developments toward Open Theism. Some contemporary Methodists have found Open Theist ideas congenial, arguing they fit well with Wesleyan emphases on preventing grace, the possibility of falling from grace, and the importance of human cooperation with divine working. Wesley himself affirmed divine foreknowledge and would not have endorsed Open Theism, but the relational and experiential dimensions of Wesleyan theology provide resources that some find conducive to Open Theist reinterpretation. The debate continues within Methodist circles about whether Open Theism represents a faithful development or a departure from Wesleyan foundations.</p>

<p>Within Evangelicalism, certain Baptist theologians anticipated Open Theist themes. In the nineteenth century, some Free Will Baptists expressed views that questioned divine foreordination and emphasized human freedom and responsibility. While they generally maintained orthodox positions on divine attributes, their pastoral concerns about preserving meaningful freedom and authentic relationship echo Open Theist motivations. The Baptist tradition's emphasis on individual conscience, personal conversion experience, and the importance of free response to the gospel created theological sensibilities that would later prove receptive to Open Theist proposals. When Open Theism became controversial in evangelical circles in the 1990s, Baptist institutions were often at the center of debates, both as venues where open theists taught and as locations where the strongest resistance emerged.</p>

<p>In the twentieth century, several theologians developed ideas that contributed to Open Theism's emergence without fully embracing its conclusions. Jurgen Moltmann's theology of hope emphasized God's engagement with a genuinely open future. Wolfhart Pannenberg explored God's temporal relationship to creation in ways that questioned classical timelessness. Process theologians like John Cobb and David Ray Griffin articulated detailed philosophical systems denying exhaustive foreknowledge, though their departures from classical theism extended far beyond this single issue. Open theists drew selectively from these sources while attempting to remain more closely aligned with orthodox Christian commitments than process theology allowed. The cross-pollination of ideas from various theological streams—Arminianism, Wesleyanism, Baptist freedom of conscience, twentieth-century theology of hope—provided the context in which Open Theism coalesced as a distinct position.</p>

<p>The development of Open Theism as an identifiable movement occurred primarily in North American evangelical scholarship from the 1980s onward. Clark Pinnock's presidential address to the Evangelical Theological Society in 1985 raised questions about classical theism's philosophical assumptions. Richard Rice published "God's Foreknowledge and Man's Free Will" in 1985, developing biblical and philosophical arguments for the open view. John Sanders, William Hasker, David Basinger, and Gregory Boyd published influential works through the 1990s, creating a critical mass of scholarly literature. Their work sparked intense controversy, leading to debates about whether Open Theism was compatible with evangelical orthodoxy. Regardless of one's assessment of Open Theism's truth, its emergence represents a significant moment in evangelical theological history, demonstrating that classical formulations of divine attributes remain subject to biblical and philosophical scrutiny.</p>
