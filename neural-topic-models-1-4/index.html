<section class="p">
<p>Bag-of-words supplies valuable frequency signals but ignores word meaning and order. Contextualized encoders such as BERT capture synonymy, polysemy, and phrase structure but can entangle local context with global themes. Contextualized Topic Models (CTMs) combine both views: BoW enters the encoder (and often the decoder) to preserve interpretability, while sentence or document embeddings inject semantics that help cluster documents consistently. The key move is multi-view inference: an encoder conditions on counts and embeddings to produce topic proportions that remain human-readable yet less brittle to vocabulary quirks.</p>
<p>Architecturally, CTMs are typically VAEs with a logistic–normal prior, like other neural topic models. The encoder reads a concatenation or learned fusion of BoW features and dense embeddings; the decoder often remains linear from topics to words to keep top-word lists clean. Some variants split content and context with two encoders whose posteriors are combined, for example via product-of-experts. Others condition the prior on embeddings so that semantically similar documents start with similar topic expectations. Both designs reduce posterior variance and improve sample efficiency on small or noisy corpora.</p>
<p>Why does this help? Consider the word “bank.” In a pure BoW model, “bank” contributes equally to finance and river contexts, muddying topics unless strong co-occurrence signals disambiguate it. With contextual embeddings, the document representation already disambiguates uses based on neighbors, steering the encoder toward the right region of topic space. The decoder can still surface top words that users recognize, but now those lists are less polluted by cross-sense collisions. The net effect is higher coherence and more stable topics across random seeds and subsampled datasets.</p>
<p>CTMs are especially attractive for multilingual or domain-shift settings. With aligned embeddings, one can share a topic decoder across languages while letting encoders handle language-specific signals. Domain adaptation follows a similar pattern: keep shared topics but condition priors on domain tags, letting proportions shift appropriately. These tricks generalize the original intuition of supervised LDA style models, but with stronger representation learning and end-to-end differentiability, avoiding brittle feature engineering and hand-tuned Dirichlet hyperparameters.</p>
<p>Practical tips matter. Use a BoW vocabulary trimmed of stopwords and ultra-rare terms; compute embeddings at document or sentence level consistently; and avoid feeding the exact same information twice (e.g., average GloVe + BERT). Warm-start the decoder with NMF or LDA topics to stabilize training. Balance the influence of embeddings with a gating mechanism or dropout; too-strong embeddings can collapse topics into a few generic themes. Monitor both ELBO and coherence/diversity metrics, since semantic signals can inflate reconstruction while harming readability if the decoder becomes overly smooth.</p>
<p>Limitations include computational cost and potential leakage of sensitive information through embeddings when training on private text. Moreover, contextual encoders evolve rapidly; upgrading them can shift the topic landscape in ways that complicate longitudinal analysis. Despite these caveats, CTMs remain a pragmatic bridge between transparent BoW-style topics and the semantic power of modern language models, often delivering the best user experience in exploratory analysis dashboards.</p>
