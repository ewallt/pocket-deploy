      <h2>Core Summary</h2>
      <p>On May 5-7, 1864, Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee clashed for the first time in the tangled Virginia forest called the Wilderness. Grant's Overland Campaign began with brutal fighting in near-zero visibility through dense second-growth woods and tangled undergrowth. Muzzle flashes ignited brush fires that burned wounded soldiers alive—their screams haunted survivors. Two days of savage combat produced over 29,000 casualties with neither side gaining decisive advantage. Every previous Union commander—McClellan, Burnside, Hooker, Meade—had retreated after such bloodbaths. On May 7, Grant turned his army south toward Spotsylvania Court House instead, beginning six weeks of relentless offensive operations. His refusal to retreat despite horrible losses signaled a fundamental change in Union strategy: continuous pressure until Confederate armies were destroyed. Lee would never regain the strategic initiative.</p>

            <strong>Grant Takes Command:</strong> In March 1864, Lincoln promoted Grant to lieutenant general and gave him command of all Union armies. Grant chose to direct operations against Lee personally, making his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac while Meade retained tactical command.
          </div>
          <div class="list-item">
            <strong>Overland Campaign Begins:</strong> Grant planned to cross the Rapidan River and move south, forcing Lee to fight in open country where Union numerical superiority would tell. The Wilderness—70 square miles of dense, tangled forest—was the last place Grant wanted to fight. Visibility was measured in yards, not miles.
          </div>
          <div class="list-item">
            <strong>Lee's Response:</strong> Rather than let Grant reach open ground, Lee attacked in the Wilderness. Fighting in the tangled woods would negate Union numerical advantage and prevent Grant from deploying artillery effectively. Lee knew the terrain intimately from Chancellorsville the previous year.

            <strong>Union:</strong> Grant commanded 118,000 troops in the Army of the Potomac (nominally under Meade). Winfield Scott Hancock, John Sedgwick, Gouverneur K.

              <strong>May 5, noon:</strong> Fighting erupts along the Orange Turnpike and Orange Plank Road. Visibility in the dense forest is almost zero. Units become disoriented. Soldiers fire at sounds and muzzle flashes. Friend fires on friend as often as foe. Indecisive, confused combat continues all day.

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <strong>May 6, dawn:</strong> Grant attacks along the entire line before Lee can concentrate his forces. Hancock's II Corps nearly breaks through A.P. Hill's battered division. Confederate collapse seems imminent. Lee personally tries to lead a Texas brigade forward but his troops refuse to advance until he withdraws to safety.

              <strong>May 6, morning:</strong> Longstreet's I Corps arrives after forced march and counterattacks Hancock's exposed flank. Union advance collapses. Longstreet prepares devastating follow-up attack but is seriously wounded by his own men—shot in the throat and shoulder while scouting. The wounding occurs less than four miles from where Stonewall Jackson fell exactly one year earlier. Confederate attacks stall without Longstreet's direction.

              <strong>May 6, afternoon:</strong> Brush fires ignited by muzzle flashes spread through the tinder-dry forest. Wounded soldiers unable to crawl to safety burn alive. Their screams echo through the woods. Both armies pause to rescue wounded when possible. The horror haunts survivors for life.

              <strong>May 7:</strong> Armies rest and tend wounded. Grant decides: rather than retreat as previous commanders had done, he will slide south toward Spotsylvania Court House.

            <strong>Terrain Neutralizes Numbers:</strong> The Wilderness's dense forest and tangled undergrowth prevented Grant from deploying his 2-to-1 numerical advantage. Artillery couldn't be positioned effectively. Cavalry was useless. Soldiers fought blind, firing at sounds and muzzle flashes. Lee's gamble to fight there paid off tactically.
          </div>
          <div class="list-item">
            <strong>Longstreet's Arrival and Wounding:</strong> Longstreet's timely flank attack on May 6 saved Lee's right wing and nearly routed Hancock's corps. His wounding—shot by the 12th Virginia Regiment in friendly fire—robbed Lee of critical leadership at the moment of potential breakthrough. Longstreet would be out of action for five months.

            <strong>Grant's Decision:</strong> Every previous Union commander in Virginia—McClellan, Burnside, Hooker, Meade—had retreated after battles like the Wilderness. Grant advanced. This single decision transformed the Eastern Theater. Continuous operations gave Lee no time to rest, refit, or maneuver. From May 1864 until April 1865, Lee fought defensively.

            <strong>No Tactical Victor:</strong> Neither side won the Wilderness decisively. Both armies held positions at battle's end. Casualties were horrific—17% Union losses, 18% Confederate—for marginal gain. Lee had stopped Grant's initial advance but failed to destroy Union forces.

          <p style="margin-bottom:1rem">The Wilderness marked the beginning of modern warfare's relentless grind. Historian Gordon Rhea notes that "Grant's decision to continue advancing after the Wilderness changed the war's character fundamentally." Previous commanders had fought a battle, counted casualties, then rested or retreated. Grant fought continuously for six weeks, giving Lee no respite. The strategy was brutal: Grant lost 55,000 casualties during the Overland Campaign—nearly as many troops as Lee commanded in total. But Union resources could sustain such losses; Confederate could not. The Wilderness's horror—wounded burning alive, bodies so thick survivors walked on corpses, fighting blind in tangled woods—previewed World War I's Western Front. Yet Grant understood modern industrial war: victory required breaking enemy will through continuous pressure, not brilliant maneuver. Lee's tactical genius still shone—his defensive fighting at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor inflicted 2-to-1 casualties. But he could not escape Grant's remorseless advance. Northern newspapers screamed "butcher" after 55,000 casualties in six weeks. Grant grimly continued. Lincoln finally had the general he needed to win.</p>
