      <p class="lead">Part 5 · Introduction to Lebesgue Theory</p>

      <article>
        <p>Lebesgue integration extends Riemann integration to a broader class of functions, enabling integration of limits, handling discontinuous functions more naturally, and providing the foundation for modern probability and functional analysis. The key innovation is partitioning the range rather than the domain: instead of dividing the interval into subintervals and summing f(xᵢ)Δxᵢ, Lebesgue integration divides the range into values and measures the set of inputs where f takes each value. This approach integrates any measurable function for which the integral is well-defined, including functions with countably many discontinuities or worse pathologies that Riemann integration cannot handle.</p>

        <p>Measure theory provides the foundation for Lebesgue integration. A σ-algebra on a set X is a collection of subsets closed under complements and countable unions, containing the empty set. A measure μ assigns non-negative extended real numbers to sets in the σ-algebra, satisfying μ(∅) = 0 and countable additivity: μ(⋃ Eₙ) = Σ μ(Eₙ) for disjoint sets Eₙ. The Lebesgue measure on ℝ extends the notion of length: intervals [a, b] have measure b − a, and μ is translation-invariant and countably additive. Remarkably, not all subsets of ℝ are measurable; non-measurable sets exist via the axiom of choice.</p>

        <p>Measurable functions are those compatible with the σ-algebra structure. A function f: X → ℝ is measurable if f⁻¹((a, ∞)) is measurable for every a ∈ ℝ. Equivalently, preimages of Borel sets (the σ-algebra generated by open sets) are measurable. Continuous functions are measurable, as are pointwise limits of measurable functions. Measurability is the analogue of continuity in measure theory: it ensures that the function interacts properly with the measure structure, enabling integration. The Dirichlet function (1 on rationals, 0 on irrationals) is measurable but not Riemann integrable.</p>

        <p>The Lebesgue integral of a non-negative measurable function f is defined via simple function approximation. A simple function is a finite linear combination Σ aᵢ χ_{Eᵢ}, where χ_E is the indicator function of E (1 on E, 0 elsewhere). The integral of a simple function is Σ aᵢ μ(Eᵢ). For a general non-negative measurable f, define ∫ f dμ = sup{∫ s dμ : s simple, s ≤ f}. This supremum captures the "area under the curve" by approximating f from below with simple functions. For functions of arbitrary sign, write f = f⁺ − f⁻ and integrate separately, provided both integrals are finite.</p>

        <p>Lebesgue integration improves on Riemann integration in several ways. The Lebesgue integral exists for all bounded measurable functions on sets of finite measure, whereas Riemann integrability requires near-continuity. Dominated convergence and monotone convergence theorems allow interchange of limits and integrals under mild conditions, failing for Riemann integrals. For example, if fₙ → f pointwise and |fₙ| ≤ g with ∫ g < ∞, then ∫ fₙ → ∫ f. This theorem is central to probability (expectations of random variables) and Fourier analysis (convergence of transforms).</p>

        <p>The relationship between Riemann and Lebesgue integrals is well-understood. A bounded function on a finite interval is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere (the set of discontinuities has measure zero). For Riemann integrable functions, the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals coincide. Thus Lebesgue integration subsumes Riemann integration while extending to a far wider class. Functions like the Dirichlet function, not Riemann integrable, are Lebesgue integrable: since rationals have measure zero, the Dirichlet function equals 0 almost everywhere, so its Lebesgue integral is 0.</p>

        <p>Lᵖ spaces generalize the notion of function spaces with integral norms. For 1 ≤ p < ∞, the space Lᵖ(X, μ) consists of measurable functions f with ∫ |f|ᵖ dμ < ∞, equipped with norm ‖f‖_p = (∫ |f|ᵖ)^(1/p). These spaces are complete (Banach spaces), unlike the space of Riemann integrable functions. L² is a Hilbert space, foundational in quantum mechanics and signal processing. Hölder's and Minkowski's inequalities govern products and sums in Lᵖ, extending Cauchy-Schwarz. Lᵖ spaces enable functional analysis techniques in partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and ergodic theory.</p>

        <p>Lebesgue theory revolutionized analysis in the early 20th century, enabling rigorous treatment of Fourier series, probability, and differential equations. Measure theory provides the language for modern probability (probability measures, random variables, expectations). The Lebesgue integral underpins distribution theory, Sobolev spaces, and weak solutions to PDEs. This final article concludes the Real Analysis series, having journeyed from foundational completeness through classical calculus to advanced function theory and measure-theoretic integration. The tools developed here form the basis for further study in functional analysis, harmonic analysis, probability, and mathematical physics.</p>
