<h1>Open Theism: Scriptural Basis and Historical Development</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 2 · Key Old Testament Texts and Open Theism</p>
<article>
<p>Genesis 6:6 states that "The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled." This text poses significant interpretive challenges for classical theism. If God possesses exhaustive foreknowledge and never changes, how can God regret a past decision? The Hebrew word "nacham" carries connotations of emotional pain, grief, and reconsideration. Open theists take the text at face value—God genuinely regrets having created humanity in light of their wickedness, experiences real grief, and reconsiders the divine relationship with creation. Classical theists typically interpret this anthropomorphically, as accommodated language describing how things appear from a human perspective rather than literal divine psychology. Open theists argue this approach systematically dismisses straightforward readings whenever they challenge philosophical precommitments.</p>

<p>The testing of Abraham in Genesis 22 provides another key text. After Abraham demonstrates willingness to sacrifice Isaac, the angel says "Now I know that you fear God" (v. 12). The language suggests God acquired knowledge through the test. If God already knew with certainty that Abraham would obey, why conduct the test? Classical theists respond that the test served purposes other than divine knowledge-acquisition—revealing Abraham's character to Abraham himself, providing an example for future generations, or making already-known facts public. Open theists find this response forced. The natural reading takes "now I know" as indicating acquired knowledge. The test was genuine, the outcome uncertain until Abraham chose, and God learned what Abraham would do by observing him do it. This reading, they argue, better fits the narrative drama and the relational portrayal of the God-Abraham relationship.</p>

<p>Moses's intercession at Sinai (Exodus 32) shows divine responsiveness to human petition. After Israel's golden calf idolatry, God announces intention to destroy them and start over with Moses. Moses pleads for Israel, reminding God of promises to the patriarchs and potential damage to divine reputation if Egypt sees God destroy the redeemed people. Verse 14 states: "Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened." Open theists see this as God genuinely changing plans in response to Moses's arguments. Classical theists interpret it as God eternally intending the outcome that includes Moses's intercession—the intercession and its effect both part of the unchanging divine will. For open theists, this makes the dialogue theatrical rather than real. If God already decided not to destroy Israel, why the narrative presenting Moses as changing God's mind?</p>

<p>The book of Jeremiah contains multiple texts crucial to Open Theist exegesis. Jeremiah 3:6-7 describes God expecting Israel to return after witnessing Judah's punishment, but Israel did not—God's expectation was disappointed. Jeremiah 3:19-20 uses marriage metaphor where God says "I thought you would call me 'Father'... But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me." The language of thought and disappointment suggests God had genuine hopes that were not realized. Most strikingly, Jeremiah 7:31 and 19:5 describe Israel's child sacrifice as something "I did not command, nor did it enter my mind." If God foreknew Israel would commit this abomination, how did it not enter God's mind? Open theists argue the text most naturally means God did not foresee this particular depth of depravity.</p>

<p>First Samuel 15 narrates God's regret over making Saul king. Verse 11 states "I regret that I have made Saul king," and verse 35 emphasizes "the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel." Between these bookends, verse 29 asserts that God "does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind." The apparent contradiction requires interpretation. Classical theists see the passages about regret as anthropomorphic, with verse 29 revealing the literal truth. Open theists argue that verse 29 appears in Samuel's rebuke to Saul and addresses a different issue—God will not change the decision to remove Saul's dynasty despite Saul's pleas, because God is not like fickle humans who vacillate. Verses 11 and 35 reveal God's authentic emotional response to Saul's failures, while verse 29 affirms God's reliable justice.</p>

<p>The portrayal of God in the prophets emphasizes passionate engagement and responsiveness. God repeatedly expresses surprise at Israel's behavior, hurt at their infidelity, and grief over necessary judgment. Hosea develops an extended metaphor of God as betrayed spouse, experiencing real emotional pain. Isaiah depicts God as disappointed parent. Ezekiel shows God searching for someone to stand in the gap to prevent judgment. While all sides agree these are metaphors, the question is what they reveal. Open theists contend the metaphors work precisely because they reflect genuine divine pathos—God really experiences grief, disappointment, and responsiveness. Classical theists worry this compromises divine impassibility and perfection. The exegetical debate centers on whether biblical language about God's emotional life should be taken as revelatory of divine reality or as pedagogical accommodation to human limitations.</p>

<p>The Old Testament's narrative arc from creation through exile portrays a God working with and through a recalcitrant people, adjusting strategies, experiencing setbacks, and remaining committed despite disappointments. The covenant relationship involves genuine reciprocity. When Israel obeys, blessing follows; when they rebel, judgment comes; when they repent, restoration occurs. This conditional dynamic appears throughout Deuteronomy and the historical books. Open theists see this pattern as revealing a God who has established genuine covenantal relationship involving libertarian freedom, where outcomes depend on actual human choices that God does not determine or exhaustively foreknow. The pattern makes most sense, they argue, if God faces a genuinely open future shaped by responsive interaction with free creatures rather than executing an unchanging eternal decree that fixes all details in advance.</p>
