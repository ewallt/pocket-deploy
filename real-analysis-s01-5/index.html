      <p class="lead">Part 5 · Compactness and Heine-Borel</p>

      <article>
        <p>Compactness abstracts properties of closed bounded intervals that enable key theorems like the Extreme Value Theorem and Bolzano-Weierstrass. In metric spaces, a set K is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. Equivalently, in ℝⁿ, compactness coincides with being closed and bounded (Heine-Borel Theorem). This equivalence simplifies verification and links topology with geometry. Compact sets behave like finite sets in many respects: continuous images of compact sets are compact, and continuous real-valued functions on compact sets are bounded and attain extrema. Compactness is foundational in topology, functional analysis, and differential geometry.</p>

        <p>An open cover of a set K is a collection {Uₐ} of open sets such that K ⊆ ⋃ Uₐ. K is compact if every such cover admits a finite subcover {Uₐ₁, …, Uₐₙ} with K ⊆ Uₐ₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ Uₐₙ. This definition captures the idea that K cannot be "too large" or "spread out infinitely." For example, (0, 1) is not compact: the cover {(1/n, 1)} for n ≥ 2 has no finite subcover. In contrast, [0, 1] is compact. The definition generalizes to arbitrary topological spaces, making compactness a central concept across mathematics.</p>

        <p>Sequential compactness provides an equivalent characterization in metric spaces: K is sequentially compact if every sequence in K has a convergent subsequence with limit in K. The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem states that every bounded sequence in ℝ has a convergent subsequence, implying that closed bounded intervals are sequentially compact. For metric spaces, compactness and sequential compactness coincide. In general topological spaces, these notions can differ, but in ℝⁿ they are equivalent. Sequential compactness often simplifies proofs by reducing to sequence arguments rather than open cover manipulations.</p>

        <p>The Heine-Borel Theorem characterizes compact subsets of ℝⁿ: a set K ⊆ ℝⁿ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Boundedness ensures that K lies within some ball, while closedness guarantees that limit points belong to K. The theorem fails in infinite-dimensional spaces: the closed unit ball in ℓ² is closed and bounded but not compact. In ℝⁿ, Heine-Borel provides a straightforward test for compactness, avoiding direct verification of open cover conditions. For instance, [a, b] is closed and bounded, hence compact; (a, b) is bounded but not closed, hence not compact.</p>

        <p>The proof of Heine-Borel in ℝ proceeds by showing closed bounded intervals are compact. Let {Uₐ} be an open cover of [a, b]. Define S = {x ∈ [a, b] : [a, x] has a finite subcover}. Then a ∈ S, so S is nonempty. Let c = sup S; completeness ensures c exists. Openness of the cover and closedness of [a, b] force c ∈ S and c = b, proving [a, b] is compact. The converse—compact sets are closed and bounded—follows from general topological arguments: compactness implies closedness in Hausdorff spaces, and the cover {(−n, n)} shows compactness implies boundedness in ℝⁿ.</p>

        <p>Compactness interacts powerfully with continuity. The continuous image of a compact set is compact: if f: K → ℝ is continuous and K is compact, then f(K) is compact. This follows from the preimage property of continuous functions: if {Vₐ} covers f(K), then {f⁻¹(Vₐ)} covers K; extracting a finite subcover for K yields a finite subcover for f(K). As a consequence, continuous real-valued functions on compact sets are bounded and attain extrema (Extreme Value Theorem), since compact sets in ℝ are closed and bounded, hence contain their supremum and infimum.</p>

        <p>Nested compact set properties reinforce the intuition that compactness prevents "disappearing into infinity." If (Kₙ) is a decreasing sequence of nonempty compact sets in a metric space, then ⋂ Kₙ is nonempty. This follows from finite intersection property: if the intersection were empty, then {Kₙᶜ} would cover K₁, contradicting compactness of K₁. Applications include Cantor's nested intervals theorem and construction of fractal sets. The property fails for non-compact sets: Kₙ = [n, ∞) has empty intersection despite each Kₙ being closed.</p>

        <p>Compactness unifies topological, metric, and algebraic perspectives in real analysis. It transforms local continuity into global uniformity, ensures existence of extrema and convergent subsequences, and provides a framework for approximation and optimization. Subsequent series will explore differentiation, integration, and function spaces, where compactness arguments remain central. Mastering compactness equips the analyst with one of the most versatile and powerful tools in modern mathematics, applicable across analysis, topology, geometry, and applied fields.</p>
