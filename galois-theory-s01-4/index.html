<h1>Galois Theory: Origins and Foundations</h1>
<p class="lead">Part 4 · Fields, Rings, and Extension Basics</p>
<article>
<p>A field is a set F equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying axioms that generalize the familiar arithmetic of rational and real numbers. Specifically, (F, +) forms an abelian group with identity 0, the nonzero elements (F*, ·) form an abelian group with identity 1, and multiplication distributes over addition: a(b + c) = ab + ac. Fields include ℚ (rationals), ℝ (reals), ℂ (complex numbers), and finite fields like ℤₚ for prime p. Every field contains a unique smallest subfield, its prime field: either ℚ or ℤₚ. Fields have no zero divisors—if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0—and every nonzero element is invertible, making polynomial division and fraction formation possible. This algebraic richness makes fields the natural setting for studying polynomial equations.</p>
<p>Rings generalize fields by relaxing the requirement that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. A ring R is a set with addition forming an abelian group and multiplication that is associative and distributes over addition. Rings need not have multiplicative identities (though most studied rings do), and nonzero elements may lack inverses or even be zero divisors. Examples include the integers ℤ (a ring but not a field, since 2 has no multiplicative inverse in ℤ), polynomial rings F[x] over a field F, and matrix rings. The polynomial ring ℚ[x] consists of polynomials with rational coefficients; it is an integral domain (no zero divisors) but not a field (polynomials of degree ≥ 1 have no inverses). Rings provide the machinery for defining ideals, quotients, and factorization, all essential in modern algebra.</p>
<p>Field extensions formalize the process of enlarging a field to include solutions of polynomial equations. If F and K are fields with F ⊆ K, we say K is an extension of F, written K/F. For example, ℂ/ℝ, ℝ/ℚ, and ℚ(√2)/ℚ are all field extensions. The extension ℚ(√2) consists of all numbers a + b√2 with a, b ∈ ℚ; this is the smallest field containing ℚ and √2. Extensions can be viewed as vector spaces: K is a vector space over F, and the dimension [K:F] is called the degree of the extension. For ℚ(√2)/ℚ, the degree is 2, since {1, √2} forms a basis. Finite extensions have finite degree, while ℝ/ℚ is an infinite extension. The degree [K:F] measures the algebraic complexity introduced by the extension.</p>
<p>Given a field F and an element α (possibly lying in some larger field), the extension F(α) is the smallest field containing both F and α. If α is algebraic over F—meaning it satisfies some nonzero polynomial f(x) ∈ F[x]—then F(α) is a finite extension, and [F(α):F] equals the degree of the minimal polynomial of α over F. The minimal polynomial is the unique monic irreducible polynomial in F[x] having α as a root. For example, √2 is algebraic over ℚ with minimal polynomial x² − 2, so [ℚ(√2):ℚ] = 2. If α is transcendental over F (not algebraic), then F(α) is isomorphic to the rational function field F(x) and is an infinite extension. The distinction between algebraic and transcendental extensions is fundamental; Galois theory primarily addresses algebraic extensions.</p>
<p>Tower laws relate degrees of successive extensions: if F ⊆ K ⊆ L are fields, then [L:F] = [L:K][K:F]. This multiplicative property simplifies degree computations. For instance, consider F = ℚ, K = ℚ(√2), and L = ℚ(√2, √3). Since √3 is not in ℚ(√2) (if it were, then √3 = a + b√2 for rationals a, b, leading to a contradiction), the minimal polynomial of √3 over ℚ(√2) is x² − 3, so [L:K] = 2. We have [K:ℚ] = 2, hence [L:ℚ] = 2 × 2 = 4. A basis for L over ℚ is {1, √2, √3, √6}. Towers of extensions correspond to sequences of subgroups in Galois theory, with degrees of extensions matching indices of subgroups via the Fundamental Theorem.</p>
<p>Splitting fields capture the idea of the smallest field over which a polynomial factors completely into linear factors. Given f(x) ∈ F[x], a splitting field for f over F is an extension K/F such that f factors completely in K[x] as f(x) = c(x − α₁)···(x − αₙ), and K = F(α₁, ..., αₙ). Splitting fields exist and are unique up to isomorphism. For example, the splitting field of x² + 1 over ℝ is ℂ, and the splitting field of x³ − 2 over ℚ is ℚ(∛2, ω) where ω = e^(2πi/3) is a primitive cube root of unity. Splitting fields are finite extensions when f has finite degree, and they are the natural setting for Galois groups: the Galois group Gal(K/F) consists of automorphisms of K that fix F, and these automorphisms permute the roots of f, connecting field extensions to permutation groups.</p>
<p>Normal and separable extensions refine the class of field extensions amenable to Galois theory. An extension K/F is normal if every irreducible polynomial in F[x] that has a root in K splits completely in K; equivalently, K is the splitting field of some family of polynomials over F. An extension is separable if every element's minimal polynomial has distinct roots (no repeated roots). In characteristic zero (e.g., extensions of ℚ or ℝ), all algebraic extensions are separable. A Galois extension is one that is both normal and separable; these are precisely the extensions for which the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory holds, establishing a bijection between intermediate fields and subgroups of the Galois group. Normal and separable conditions ensure that automorphisms permute roots predictably and that the extension is determined by symmetries, making the group-theoretic machinery applicable and powerful.</p>
