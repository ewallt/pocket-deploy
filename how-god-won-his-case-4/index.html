<h1>What Sin Actually Does</h1>
<p class="intro">Sin does not bring death by decree but by reality—it unplugs the soul from the only source of life.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
<p>From the beginning, the warning “you will surely die” described a consequence, not a threat. Separation from God is separation from existence itself. The tragedy of sin is not that it provokes divine retaliation but that it rejects the only Power capable of sustaining being. When the life-connection is cut, ruin follows as night follows sunset.</p>
<p>The cross exposes this truth. The Father does not kill the Son; He allows Him to bear the results of sin’s atmosphere, the violence of deceived hearts, and the withdrawal of life from the source of love. What happens there is not execution but revelation—sin showing what it really does when unhindered.</p>
<p>Religious history confirms the same principle. Whenever people imagine God as a destroyer, they become destroyers themselves. When fear is worshiped, cruelty becomes holy. The worst crimes have often worn the robes of devotion, proving that false ideas of God reproduce their own likeness in those who hold them.</p>
<p>Understanding sin as intrinsic ruin restores both sanity and hope. The divine judgment is not arbitrary sentencing but the unveiling of truth: what we have chosen and what that choice inherently brings. God’s role is that of a physician explaining the diagnosis, not a tyrant enforcing penalties.</p>
<p>Repentance, then, is not bargaining for leniency but returning to trust. Healing begins when the patient allows the Healer to reconnect the broken circuit. Life is received, not earned. The universe learns that freedom without trust is death disguised as liberty.</p>
<p>This understanding vindicates God’s warnings and reveals His patience. He grieves, but He never coerces. Love must remain free even when it hurts, for only freedom makes love real.</p>
