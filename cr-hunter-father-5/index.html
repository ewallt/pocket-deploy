<header class="h"><h1>Seeing Through the Misunderstanding</h1><p class="intro">*Reading hard texts with the Father’s heart restores trust and clarity.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The parable ends with a choice for the listener: will we judge the father by the snippet we overheard or by the love that sent him into the conversation? Scripture invites the second. It asks us to read with the assumption that God is always saving, even when the words sound like mere management.</p>
<p>Seeing through the misunderstanding begins with Christ. He is the true image of the Father—touching lepers, blessing enemies, refusing to coerce. If a passage seems to depict a different God, the Hunter Father reminds us to look again for accommodation at work.</p>
<p>Next comes context. What decisions had the people already made? What evils were being restrained? What alternatives would withdrawal have left? These questions uncover the saving motive hidden inside regulatory language.</p>
<p>Then comes trajectory. Do we see movement toward the creation ideal—toward peace, justice, and covenant faithfulness? If so, the text is doing the same work the father did: keeping the child close until the child can see why the father never hunted.</p>
<p>Read this way, trust grows. The God who stays involved proves beautiful and believable. We stop confusing permission with approval and begin to recognize a Father who would rather risk misunderstanding than lose us.</p>
<p>That recognition changes how we treat others. We choose presence over posturing, patient guidance over proud distance. In doing so, we bear witness to the Hunter Father and help the world hear what His words were always meant to say.</p>
