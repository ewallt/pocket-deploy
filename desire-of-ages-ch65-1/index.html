<header class="h"><h1>The Temple Cleansed Again — Part 1: House of Prayer for All Nations</h1><p class="intro">Jesus’ righteous zeal is restorative: He clears space so the world can meet God without paywalls or pretense.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The chapter opens on noise. Animals crowd the court, coins clatter, bargaining drowns prayer. The place designed for seekers—especially Gentiles—has become a shortcut for profit. When Jesus enters, His presence silences the frenzy before His words do. The authority is moral, not muscular, yet it scatters the market as surely as if walls had fallen. Judgment begins as revelation: this is what God thinks of worship that tramples people.</p>
<p>His indictment quotes Scripture, stitching together Isaiah’s welcome and Jeremiah’s warning: “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations … but you have made it a den of thieves.” The collision exposes two betrayals at once—prayer displaced by profit, and mission to the nations displaced by convenience for insiders. Cleansing is therefore missional. It re-centers the temple’s vocation: intercession, instruction, and access for the far-off who are drawing near.</p>
<p>Importantly, Jesus does not replace merchants with mere quiet. He replaces commerce with communion. The cleared court becomes a sanctuary again—space for listening, lament, gratitude. The act is not anti-body or anti-economy; it is anti-exploitation. God is not against buying doves somewhere; He is against selling them here at the cost of the poor and the outsider’s welcome. The sign points forward to a community where prayer is not pay-to-play and where peace is not for sale.</p>
<p>The scene also interprets His identity. Only the Lord of the house can speak this way about the house. Prophets had protested; priests had presided. Jesus does more. He claims the temple as His Father’s, and by that claim reveals Himself as Son. The authority that frightens oppressors frees the oppressed. No wonder the powerful plot and the powerless hope.</p>
<p>Personal application follows naturally. Any practice—religious or otherwise—that turns people into means needs His overturning. We ask what in our rhythms blocks seekers, burdens the poor, or commodifies the holy. Then we invite Christ to cleanse what we cannot defend, trusting that on the other side of disruption is deeper prayer. He drives out to draw in.</p>
<p>Finally, the title phrase “for all nations” enlarges our horizon. The court He clears is the nations’ porch; by reclaiming it, He previews a future in which worshipers stream in from everywhere. Cleansing is not closure but opening. The holy noise that will now fill the court—prayer, praise, and mercy—will be the world’s invitation: there is room for you, and the door is open.</p>
