<section class="p">
<p>“Behold the Lamb of God” is an invitation to look until our hearts change. The title gathers the whole story: sacrifice without resentment, authority without threat, purity without distance. In the Lamb, heaven’s power appears as vulnerable goodness that refuses to turn enemies into prey.</p>
<p>The cross is not a detour but the map. It shows how God relates to evil—neither accommodating it nor mirroring it. He defeats it by truth-telling, forgiveness, and endurance. The blood speaks better things because it testifies to a justice that heals, not merely balances accounts.</p>
<p>To worship the Lamb is to adopt His means. Discipleship becomes imitation of cruciform love in ordinary places: bearing wrong without bitterness, telling the truth without contempt, serving without applause. Holiness is proximity to this character, not withdrawal from a needy world.</p>
<p>Mission follows revelation. When the Lamb is lifted up, people are drawn not by fear of consequences but by the beauty of God’s heart. The gospel is credible where communities embody patience, mercy, and courage that resemble their Lord.</p>
<p>Hope rests here as well. The One who kept faith under maximum pressure will keep faith with us. Resurrected, He carries scars that promise recognition: the Judge is the Savior; the Sovereign is the Servant; the end will match the cross that defines the center.</p>
<p>So we keep looking. In every doctrine, story, and practice, we ask: does this sound like the Lamb? If not, we adjust our vision. If yes, we hold it fast. To behold is to become—and in becoming, we bear witness to the truth that sets the universe free.</p>
