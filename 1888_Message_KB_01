The 1888 Message: Historical Setting and Main Figures
1. Overview
The “1888 message” refers to a distinctive presentation of righteousness by faith given within Seventh-day Adventism in the late nineteenth century, especially at the General Conference Session in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1888. Its central thrust was a Christ-centered emphasis on justification by faith, the exaltation of Christ’s righteousness, and the role of the gospel within the three angels’ messages. The key human agents were two relatively young ministers, Ellet J. Waggoner and Alonzo T. Jones, whose teaching received strong public support from Ellen G. White and sharp resistance from several influential Adventist leaders.
The Minneapolis meetings did not produce a formal new creed or an officially voted theological statement. Rather, the “1888 message” names a way of preaching and understanding the gospel and law, Christ and righteousness, that left a deep and contested imprint on Adventist history.

2. Historical Context
2.1 Adventism in the 1880s
By the 1880s, the Seventh-day Adventist Church had:
A firmly established identity rooted in prophecy, the seventh-day Sabbath, and the sanctuary message.


A strong emphasis on the law of God, particularly in contrast to Sunday observance.


A developing educational and publishing system, and a growing worldwide mission.


At the same time, there were early signs of institutional self-confidence and what later would be called a tendency toward legalism: a stress on doctrinal correctness and obedience sometimes overshadowing the centrality of Christ and the gospel. The wider American religious context included debates over law, grace, and sanctification, as well as national Sunday legislation efforts that Adventists opposed vigorously.
2.2 The Minneapolis General Conference Session
The 1888 General Conference Session was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from mid-October to early November. It was preceded by a ministerial institute where much of the theological discussion began. The meetings became a focal point for controversy around several issues:
The nature of the “law in Galatians” (whether Paul was speaking primarily of the moral law, the ceremonial law, or both).


The meaning of righteousness by faith and its relationship to obedience and the law.


The person and work of Christ, especially His divinity, humanity, and role in justification.


The discussions were sometimes heated. Personal tensions, longstanding disagreements, and institutional loyalties all contributed to resistance or support for the message being presented.

3. Key Figures
3.1 Ellet J. Waggoner (1855–1916)
E. J. Waggoner was a physician turned pastor and editor, associated with the Signs of the Times in California. His theological development led him to emphasize:
Justification by faith as a present, personal reality grounded in Christ alone.


The centrality of Christ’s righteousness in both justification and sanctification.


The idea that Paul’s “law in Galatians” included the moral law, used pedagogically to lead sinners to Christ.


Waggoner’s views were developed in articles and later in his book Christ and His Righteousness, which portrays Christ as fully divine and emphasizes the sufficiency of His righteousness for the believer.
3.2 Alonzo T. Jones (1850–1923)
A. T. Jones, a former soldier and later a powerful preacher and writer, was also associated with Adventist periodicals on the West Coast. He became known for:
Strong preaching on justification by faith.


Expositions of the book of Romans and other New Testament texts highlighting the primacy of Christ’s righteousness.


Vigorous defense of religious liberty during the national Sunday law agitations, linking gospel freedom to liberty of conscience.


Jones quickly aligned with Waggoner’s theological emphasis, and the two came to be seen as a united front presenting a fresh, Christ-centered message to the denomination.
3.3 Ellen G. White (1827–1915)
Ellen White, widely recognized within Adventism as bearing the prophetic gift, played a crucial role in the 1888 era:
She spoke repeatedly in support of the core gospel emphasis presented by Jones and Waggoner.


She described their message as sent by God and as a “most precious message,” highlighting Christ, His righteousness, and the need for the Holy Spirit.


She also rebuked personal attitudes, prejudices, and resistance among ministers and leaders, pointing to spiritual issues beneath the theological disputes.


Her involvement anchored the 1888 message in the broader spiritual and prophetic self-understanding of Adventism and lent it enduring significance.
3.4 Other Leaders and Opponents
Several established leaders played important roles in the controversy:
George I. Butler, then General Conference president, was deeply involved in defending traditional positions on the law in Galatians and worried that Waggoner’s views might weaken the church’s Sabbath message.


Uriah Smith, long-time editor of the Review and Herald, also opposed key aspects of Waggoner’s positions and felt that the new emphasis was unnecessary or dangerous.


A number of ministers and delegates took sides, often influenced as much by relationships and personality clashes as by careful doctrinal analysis.


The result was a divided leadership, with some cautious, some supportive, and others frankly opposed to the new emphasis.

4. Core Theological Issues at Minneapolis
4.1 The Law in Galatians
One major flashpoint was the interpretation of Paul’s references to “the law” in Galatians, especially as “our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.” The key questions were:
Does “the law” here mean primarily the ceremonial law, abolished at the cross?


Or does it also include the moral law, functioning to convict of sin and drive the sinner to Christ?


The traditional Adventist position, associated with earlier leaders, tended to see the law in Galatians as chiefly ceremonial, in order to safeguard the continuing authority of the moral law and the Sabbath. Waggoner argued that the text included the moral law, precisely because it reveals sin and leads to Christ, not because it undermines the Sabbath.
The debate over this issue became intertwined with personalities and institutional loyalties, making it more contentious than a purely exegetical dispute.
4.2 Righteousness by Faith and the Law
Another central issue was the relationship between righteousness by faith and obedience to the law:
Waggoner and Jones emphasized that justification is entirely on the basis of Christ’s righteousness received by faith, not by law-keeping.


They argued that the law has a crucial, but subordinate, role as it reveals sin and drives the sinner to Christ, and that true obedience is the fruit, not the ground, of justification.


Some leaders feared that this emphasis would undercut Adventism’s distinctive stress on commandment keeping and the Sabbath, or would encourage laxity.


The discussions forced Adventists to confront how the law and gospel fit together in their end-time message: whether law had become too central at the expense of the gospel, or whether gospel preaching might weaken commitment to distinctive truths.
4.3 Christology
Underlying the debates about justification and law were questions about Christ’s person and work:
Waggoner’s teaching upheld the full divinity of Christ, affirming that He shares the fullness of the Godhead.


He stressed the union of the divine and human in Christ and the sufficiency of His life and death as the basis of righteousness for believers.


This Christ-centered theology pushed against lingering semi-Arian currents among some early Adventists and contributed to the church’s later, clearer Trinitarian and Christological formulations.

5. Immediate Aftermath and Longer-Term Impact
5.1 Short-Term Reactions
In the immediate aftermath of Minneapolis:
The church did not adopt any formal statement codifying the 1888 message, nor did it issue a clear official repudiation.


Resistance, suspicion, and misunderstanding persisted in various places and among many leaders.


Ellen White continued to support the core gospel emphasis while also counseling Jones and Waggoner on issues of spirit, tact, and balance in their teaching.


The years following 1888 saw both powerful revivals and ongoing tensions, as the ideas spread through camp meetings, publications, and local churches.
5.2 Long-Term Theological Influence
Over time, the 1888 era contributed to:
A deepened Adventist appreciation of justification by faith and the centrality of Christ in the plan of salvation.


The gradual movement of Adventist theology toward a more explicit affirmation of Christ’s full deity and of the Trinity.


Renewed discussion of the relationship between law and gospel, and of the nature of Christian perfection and obedience in the last days.


Different interpretations of what exactly happened in 1888 and how fully the message was received have emerged, leading to ongoing debates about its significance and the degree of continuity or discontinuity with current Adventist teaching.

6. Significance for Adventist Identity
The 1888 message occupies a unique place in Adventist memory for several reasons:
It represents a moment when the church was confronted with the need to re-center its proclamation on Christ’s righteousness and the gospel.


It raised searching questions about doctrinal pride, institutional self-confidence, and the danger of emphasizing law and identity over the good news of God’s grace in Christ.


It provided a reference point for later calls to revival, reformation, and a more Christ-centered Adventism.


For some, 1888 stands as a largely positive turning point in Adventist theology. For others, it remains a symbol of a largely unaccepted or only partially understood message whose full implications have yet to be realized. In any case, its historical setting and main figures frame a story in which questions of law, gospel, Christ, and the church’s mission converge in a particularly intense way.
