  <h1>The Cross as Evidence</h1>
  <p class="intro">At the center of the case stands a public demonstration: God would rather suffer wrong than do wrong.</p>
</header>
<section class="p">
  <p>The trial of divine character could not be settled by counterclaims. Words would never suffice where suspicion had taken root. What was needed was a disclosure strong enough to quiet fear without canceling freedom, a revelation that could be examined, remembered, and tested by every watcher in the universe. The cross fulfills this need. It is the historical moment in which God places Himself on display under the heaviest pressures, letting all see how He behaves when hatred and injustice do their worst.</p>
  <p>At the cross, coercion is conspicuously absent. Legions are not summoned, threats are not uttered, and enemies are not annihilated. Instead, we witness patience, self-control, and faithful goodwill toward those who misunderstand and harm. If the accusation claimed that divine government rests on force and self-interest, the crucified One answers by absorbing violence without returning it. This is not passivity; it is principled strength, revealing what kind of power rules reality.</p>
  <p>The cross also clarifies the meaning of righteousness. Righteousness is not a bare legal status detached from the truth about God; it is God being who He is—utterly reliable, transparent, and healing in purpose. By making this reality visible in suffering, He establishes that His way of setting things right does not bypass freedom or evidence. Faith, then, is not credulity but reasonable trust in a character shown to be worthy of confidence.</p>
  <p>In this light, reconciliation becomes intelligible. Alienation began with lies believed; peace returns when the truth is seen. The cross speaks to minds as much as to hearts. It untangles the slanders that painted God as severe and untrustworthy, showing instead a steadfast goodness that does not fluctuate with circumstance. The more closely one looks, the less plausible the accusations appear, until suspicion has no honest foothold left.</p>
  <p>Finally, the cross is universal in scope. Its meaning addresses not only our guilt but the cosmic questions that preceded us. Heaven itself is satisfied by what is revealed there, not because might has prevailed but because reality has been unveiled. With the evidence complete, the case can be decided on the only basis that safeguards love: the willing conviction of free beings.</p>
