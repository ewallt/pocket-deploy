<header class="h"><h1>The Temple Cleansed Again — Part 5: A Cleansed Space, An Open Door</h1><p class="intro">The point of purging is not a tidier religion but a wider welcome—the nations’ porch restored for prayer.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Jesus’ citation of Isaiah is a blueprint: “a house of prayer for all nations.” The court He reclaims is the very place designed for outsiders to draw near. When profiteers occupied it, mission collapsed into maintenance. After cleansing, the temple’s architecture finally matches its theology. Space becomes invitation, and the soundscape shifts from commerce to compassion—psalms, petitions, and stories of fresh mercy.</p>
<p>The open door is costly to keep open. It requires vigilance against subtle recurrences of the market—fees disguised as expectations, status disguised as reverence, gatekeeping disguised as zeal. Communities that want the nations to find room must budget for access, train for hospitality, and measure success by how easily the small can breathe within their walls. The Son’s zeal becomes our guardrail.</p>
<p>“For all nations” also means all kinds. The court must hold lament as well as laughter, questions as well as creed, fatigue as well as fervor. A prayer-house fit for the world will not fear complexity; it will bring it to God with confidence that He loves the world more than we do. In such a place, the poor are neighbors, the foreigner is family, and the broken become builders.</p>
<p>We learn, too, to see cleansing as pastoral practice. Leaders regularly ask: What tables have crept back in? Which thresholds have risen unnoticed? Whose prayers are shortest because they are least believed? Then, gently and firmly, we clear the clutter—policies, habits, assumptions—that blocks seekers from the Presence the temple was made to host.</p>
<p>None of this diminishes holiness; it reveals it. Holiness is not fragility fenced off from sinners; it is love that makes sinners safe. The renewed court radiates the character of its Lord: truthful, generous, approachable, and joyfully public. Its witness is architectural—anyone can feel what matters here by standing in the room.</p>
<p>At last the temple becomes what it was meant to be: a sign of a larger welcome that will outlive stone. Soon the veil will tear and access will widen again, but this day’s cleansing already announces the gospel’s trajectory. God is opening His house, not shrinking it. Our work is to keep the door on its hinges, the floor clear, and the prayers rising for the world He loves.</p>
