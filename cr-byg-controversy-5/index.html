<header class="h"><h1>The Origin of Distrust: From Lucifer’s Doubt to Rebellion</h1><p>How doubt matures into opposition—and why God would not end it by force.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Distrust did not erupt in a moment. Pride sought justification, then built a case. Lucifer questioned God’s motives, reinterpreted His justice as severity and His mercy as weakness, and won sympathy by portraying himself as a reformer. This is how sin grows: from self-regard to suspicion, from suspicion to accusation, from accusation to schism.</p>
<p>God gave time and light. He disclosed the implications of Lucifer’s course and appealed to him personally. There were moments when repentance lay within reach, but self-justification chose otherwise. The controversy thus entered a new phase: not misunderstanding, but refusal of truth. Even then, God did not coerce. Love cannot be commanded into the heart; it must be won.</p>
<p>Why didn’t God simply remove the rebel? Because the universe did not yet understand sin or its end. To destroy the deceiver then would have confirmed the very charge that God maintains order by force. Instead, God committed Himself to a longer, costlier path: He would allow sin to reveal itself fully and, in doing so, reveal Himself fully.</p>
<p>This commitment shapes redemptive history. On earth, the same principle governs: God persuades; the enemy coerces. Jesus’ life embodies this—truth spoken without retaliation, goodness given without partiality, the cross accepted without calling legions of angels. There, the weapons of the two governments stand exposed.</p>
<p>The lesson is practical. Distrust grows where we cherish self and interpret God through the lens of suspicion. Trust grows where we behold Him as He is—patient, truthful, self-giving. The gospel restores confidence in God, not by arguments alone, but by the revelation of His character.</p>
<p>The story now descends to our world. The deceiver who misrepresented God in heaven would misrepresent Him on earth. The need is therefore the same: a clear revelation of God’s character that sweeps away the lie. That revelation will be our next step.</p>
