<header class="h"><h1>Beyond ℝ</h1><p class="intro">BWT in ℝⁿ, metric spaces, and where the theorem breaks down.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>BWT extends naturally to ℝⁿ: every bounded sequence in ℝⁿ has a convergent subsequence. The proof generalizes the one-dimensional bisection argument. A sequence in ℝⁿ is bounded if all coordinates are bounded. Apply BWT coordinate-by-coordinate via a diagonalization: extract a subsequence converging in the first coordinate, then a sub-subsequence converging in the second, and so on. After n steps, you have a subsequence converging in all coordinates, hence converging in ℝⁿ. This argument reveals that BWT in ℝⁿ is essentially BWT in ℝ applied dimension-wise, plus the fact that finite-dimensional products preserve convergence. Heine–Borel in ℝⁿ (closed and bounded ⟺ compact) follows, and all the consequences—EVT, Heine–Cantor—carry over to continuous functions on compact subsets of ℝⁿ.</p>
<p>In infinite-dimensional spaces, BWT fails spectacularly. Consider the sequence of standard basis vectors eₙ in ℓ², the space of square-summable sequences with the norm ‖x‖ = √(Σ xᵢ²). The sequence (eₙ) is bounded: ‖eₙ‖ = 1 for all n. Yet (eₙ) has no convergent subsequence—any two basis vectors are distance √2 apart, so no subsequence can be Cauchy. The closed unit ball in infinite-dimensional normed spaces is typically not sequentially compact. This breakdown underscores that finite dimension is crucial for BWT. In infinite dimensions, compactness becomes rare and precious; spaces and subsets that are compact (like certain function spaces with weak topologies) become objects of special study.</p>
<p>BWT holds in any sequentially compact metric space, by definition. But which spaces are sequentially compact? In general metric spaces, sequential compactness is equivalent to being complete and totally bounded (for every ε, cover the space with finitely many ε-balls). Total boundedness is automatic in ℝⁿ for bounded sets but fails in infinite dimensions. Thus BWT's scope is essentially: complete, totally bounded metric spaces. This characterization clarifies when BWT-like theorems hold. For instance, in spaces of continuous functions with the supremum norm, the Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem gives conditions (equicontinuity and pointwise boundedness) under which a sequence has a uniformly convergent subsequence—a BWT analog tailored to function spaces.</p>
<p>BWT also fails in incomplete spaces. In ℚ, the sequence of rational approximations to √2 is bounded but has no convergent subsequence within ℚ. Completeness (no missing limits) is necessary for BWT. Similarly, in metric spaces that are not complete, bounded sequences may cluster toward points outside the space, yielding no convergent subsequence inside. BWT depends on both boundedness (keeping the sequence corralled) and completeness (ensuring accumulation points exist in the space). Remove either, and the theorem fails.</p>
<p>In topological spaces beyond metric spaces, sequential compactness and compactness can diverge. There exist compact spaces that are not sequentially compact, and vice versa. The equivalence of these notions in metric spaces is special. In general topology, compactness is defined via open covers, and sequential compactness becomes one of many possible "flavors" of compactness. BWT, as a sequential statement, applies most naturally in metric contexts. Extending BWT to very general spaces requires either restricting to first-countable or metrizable spaces, or rephrasing the result in terms of nets and filters—generalizations of sequences that handle arbitrary topologies.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the spirit of BWT—boundedness forcing accumulation—pervades analysis. In probability, the Helly Selection Theorem and Prokhorov's Theorem provide BWT-like results for sequences of probability measures, identifying when bounded (in a suitable sense) families have convergent subsequences. In functional analysis, various compactness criteria (compact operators, compact embeddings) generalize the idea that certain bounded sets are "small enough" to guarantee convergent subsequences. BWT's legacy is the recognition that boundedness plus appropriate structure (completeness, finite dimension, or a substitute like total boundedness or weak compactness) yields extractable convergence. Understanding where BWT works and where it fails sharpens intuition about the geometry and topology of analysis.</p>
