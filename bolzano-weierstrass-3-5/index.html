      <article>
        <p>Bolzano–Weierstrass extends gracefully to higher dimensions: every bounded sequence in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) has a convergent subsequence. The proof mimics the one-dimensional argument by projecting onto each coordinate. We first extract a convergent subsequence of the first coordinate using the one-dimensional theorem, then refine the subsequence so the second coordinate converges, and so on. The resulting diagonal subsequence converges in all coordinates simultaneously. Compactness of closed and bounded subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) follows immediately.</p>

        <p>In general metric spaces \((X,d)\), the theorem does not hold without additional assumptions. Boundedness alone does not ensure sequential compactness; consider the open unit ball in an infinite-dimensional Banach space. Sequences can stay bounded yet fail to possess convergent subsequences because the space lacks total boundedness. This observation motivates definitions of compactness that require both boundedness and some form of completeness or finite covering property.</p>

        <p>For Hilbert and Banach spaces, analysts often work with weak topologies. The Banach–Alaoglu theorem, for instance, states that the closed unit ball in the dual space is compact in the weak-* topology. Here, Bolzano–Weierstrass reemerges in a new guise: bounded sequences have weakly convergent subsequences even when strong convergence fails. Such results illustrate how changing the topology can recover compactness-like behavior.</p>

        <p>Other settings reveal the limits of the theorem. In non-Hausdorff spaces, sequences can converge to multiple points; in non-metric topologies, sequences may not detect compactness at all, requiring nets or filters instead. Even in metric spaces, dropping completeness leads to counterexamples such as bounded sequences in \(\mathbb{Q}\) lacking convergent subsequences within \(\mathbb{Q}\) itself. Each failure highlights which structural ingredient—completeness, total boundedness, or separation—is missing.</p>

        <p>Understanding these variations prepares you for advanced topics. In differential geometry, compact manifolds guarantee convergence of geodesic subsequences, while in probability theory, Prokhorov’s theorem characterizes tight families of measures as relatively compact in the weak topology. Across these domains, the spirit of Bolzano–Weierstrass persists: control over size plus appropriate topological conditions yields convergence.</p>

        <p>This concludes the Bolzano–Weierstrass series. We began with motivation and ε-language, progressed through bounded sequences and formal proofs, and arrived at the machinery and consequences that permeate higher mathematics. The theorem’s versatility makes it a cornerstone for rigorous reasoning about infinity.</p>
