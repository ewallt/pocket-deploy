<section class="p">
<p>Before Christ, humanity saw power as the measure of divinity. Gods ruled by command and fear. Into that expectation came One who healed the broken, washed feet, and forgave His enemies. In Jesus, the invisible God stepped into visibility, not through splendor but through love.</p>
<p>The disciples learned that seeing God meant unlearning dominance. The Creator stooped to serve His creatures. Authority, redefined, became the ability to restore rather than control. Each act of compassion unmasked what heaven’s throne had always been—the seat of self-giving grace.</p>
<p>To Philip’s request, “Show us the Father,” Jesus replied, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father.” The answer shattered every notion of divine aloofness. God was no distant ruler hidden in clouds, but a Friend who entered suffering to heal it from within.</p>
<p>The Incarnation was not disguise but disclosure. The carpenter’s hands were the hands that shaped galaxies. The patience of Christ with sinners was the patience of the eternal God. Nothing essential was left unseen; divinity had spoken in a human life.</p>
<p>When the world looked upon Jesus, it saw its Maker unmasked. The cross would soon show that love’s strength was not in survival, but in sacrifice—the clearest window yet into the heart of God.</p>
