<header class="h"><h1>Gethsemane — Part 5: “Whom Seek Ye?”</h1><p class="intro">When the mob arrives, Jesus governs the moment with mercy—protecting friends, healing foes, and yielding by choice.</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>Judas leads the way, greeting with a kiss that feels colder than chains. Jesus answers with a word that still startles: “Friend.” The title is not denial; it is deliberate refusal to mirror treachery. Then He steps forward to meet the cohort: “Whom seek ye?” “Jesus of Nazareth.” “I am He.” The divine Name on human lips knocks them backward. No soldier takes the Christ by force; the Christ gives Himself.</p>
<p>He shelters His own. “If you seek Me, let these go their way.” The good shepherd keeps covenant with a frightened flock. In the confusion, a sword flashes—Peter, earnest and unready, cuts off the ear of the high priest’s servant. Jesus rebukes the method and repairs the damage in one movement, touching the wound of the very system arresting Him. The kingdom will not advance by maiming its enemies.</p>
<p>“Put up thy sword.” He names the futility of coercion and the sufficiency of providence. Twelve legions of angels stand ready, but He will not summon them; Scripture must be fulfilled. Power restrained by love is harder than power displayed. The restraint is not weakness; it is alignment with a story long told and now reaching its hour—the Song of the Suffering Servant sung in a garden before it is sung on a hill.</p>
<p>To the crowd He tells the truth. “Are you come out as against a thief…? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple.” Darkness chooses its optics. Arrest at night avoids witnesses who might remember mercy. Yet even here Jesus bears witness to the open, public character of His mission: no plots, no shadows, no manipulations—only light refused until it is bound.</p>
<p>The disciples flee. Their fear is not endorsed, only understood. The Shepherd had predicted the scattering, and He will gather them again. For now, He stands alone by choice, having already won the inward victory that makes outward surrender possible. The hands that will soon be tied are the same hands that just healed an enemy; the lips that will be mocked have just called a traitor “friend.”</p>
<p>Gethsemane’s arrest thus reads as revelation, not merely tragedy. We see a Lord who rules by truth, protects the weak, rejects the sword, fulfills the Word, and walks unguarded into pain for the joy set before Him. The question He asked the mob returns to us as invitation. Whom seek we? If it is this Jesus, the path is clear: follow Him into a courage that looks like mercy and a victory that looks like love.</p>
