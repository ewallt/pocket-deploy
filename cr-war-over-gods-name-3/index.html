<header class="h"><h1>Satan’s Picture of God</h1><p class="intro">*When a lie about God feels plausible because fear makes it so.*</p></header>
<section class="p">
<p>The enemy’s strategy is not crude atheism but a rebrand: God as exacting, touchy, and fundamentally unsafe. In this story, rules protect God from sinners rather than sinners from ruin. Prayer becomes negotiation. Obedience becomes insurance. The result is compliance without love and distance dressed as reverence.</p>
<p>This counterfeit speaks in half-truths. Justice is real, but it is portrayed as payback rather than faithfulness. Holiness is real, but it is framed as fragility instead of steadfast goodness. Mercy is mentioned, then hedged with suspicion, as though kindness were a loophole God reluctantly allows.</p>
<p>The caricature wins followers because it mirrors human systems. We know empires that preserve order by fear; we have met leaders who cannot be crossed. Projecting such patterns upward feels realistic. But realism that begins in our wounds will always miss the reality revealed in Christ.</p>
<p>The psychological toll is severe. When God is thought severe, confession hides rather than heals. When He is imagined moody, assurance evaporates. The soul oscillates between scrupulosity and despair, driven by the impossible task of placating a deity who cannot be pleased.</p>
<p>Jesus dismantles the lie by proximity. He touches lepers, welcomes traitors, forgives enemies, and exposes religious pride—then asks us to infer the Father’s heart from His own. If He is the image of the invisible God, then severity cannot be the center. Love is.</p>
<p>To resist the slander is to keep looking at Christ until the mask falls away. As the true picture takes hold, fear loosens its grip, and worship becomes gratitude, not appeasement. The Name is defended not by argument alone, but by beholding.</p>
