      <p class="lead">Part 4 · Properties of Continuous Functions</p>

      <article>
        <p>Continuous functions on closed bounded intervals exhibit remarkable global properties derived from completeness. The Extreme Value Theorem states that if f: [a, b] → ℝ is continuous, then f attains both a maximum and a minimum on [a, b]. This result contrasts sharply with behavior on open intervals: f(x) = 1/x on (0, 1) is continuous but unbounded, hence has no maximum. The theorem relies fundamentally on compactness of closed bounded intervals in ℝ, illustrating how topological properties translate into analytical conclusions. Extreme value guarantees underpin optimization, calculus of variations, and economic equilibrium theory.</p>

        <p>The proof of the Extreme Value Theorem proceeds via boundedness and supremum arguments. First, continuity on [a, b] implies boundedness: if f were unbounded above, a sequence (xₙ) in [a, b] would satisfy f(xₙ) → ∞. By Bolzano-Weierstrass, (xₙ) has a convergent subsequence (x_{nₖ}) → c ∈ [a, b]. Continuity at c forces f(x_{nₖ}) → f(c), contradicting unboundedness. Hence f is bounded, and M = sup{f(x) : x ∈ [a, b]} exists. A similar argument shows f attains this supremum at some point in [a, b], completing the proof.</p>

        <p>The Intermediate Value Theorem asserts that if f: [a, b] → ℝ is continuous and k lies between f(a) and f(b), then there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that f(c) = k. This captures the intuitive idea that continuous functions cannot "jump" over values. Applications include root-finding algorithms, fixed-point theorems, and topological degree theory. The theorem fails on disconnected domains: f(x) = 1/x on [−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1] is continuous but does not attain every value between f(−1) and f(1). Connectedness of the domain is essential.</p>

        <p>The proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem constructs the desired c via bisection. Assume f(a) < k < f(b). Define sets A = {x ∈ [a, b] : f(x) < k} and B = {x ∈ [a, b] : f(x) ≥ k}. Set c = sup A; completeness guarantees c exists. Sequential continuity shows f(c) = k: if f(c) < k, continuity implies f(x) < k near c, contradicting c = sup A; if f(c) > k, then f(x) > k near c, implying smaller upper bounds for A. Hence f(c) = k, and the theorem holds.</p>

        <p>Uniform continuity strengthens pointwise continuity by requiring δ to depend only on ε, not on the point c. A function f is uniformly continuous on a set E if for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that |f(x) − f(y)| < ε whenever x, y ∈ E satisfy |x − y| < δ. Every uniformly continuous function is continuous, but the converse is false: f(x) = x² on ℝ is continuous but not uniformly continuous, since larger x require smaller δ. Uniform continuity simplifies integration theory and ensures that Cauchy sequences map to Cauchy sequences.</p>

        <p>The Heine-Cantor Theorem states that every continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous. For f continuous on [a, b], given ε > 0, continuity at each x provides δₓ. The open cover {(x − δₓ, x + δₓ)} of [a, b] has a finite subcover by compactness. Taking δ as the minimum of finitely many δₓ values yields uniform continuity. This theorem demonstrates how compactness upgrades local properties to uniform global properties, a recurring theme in analysis. Non-compact domains may fail: f(x) = 1/x on (0, 1) is continuous but not uniformly continuous.</p>

        <p>Lipschitz continuity provides a quantitative strengthening. A function f is Lipschitz continuous if there exists L such that |f(x) − f(y)| ≤ L|x − y| for all x, y. The constant L bounds the rate of change; every Lipschitz function is uniformly continuous (take δ = ε/L). Lipschitz functions arise in metric geometry, differential equations (Picard-Lindelöf theorem), and numerical analysis. Not all uniformly continuous functions are Lipschitz: f(x) = √x on [0, 1] is uniformly continuous but not Lipschitz near 0, where the derivative becomes unbounded.</p>

        <p>These theorems illustrate how continuity interacts with domain properties to produce powerful global results. Compactness, connectedness, and completeness combine with continuity to guarantee extrema, intermediate values, and uniform behavior. Subsequent articles will explore compactness in detail, revealing its central role in real analysis and broader mathematical structures. Understanding these properties equips the analyst with essential tools for solving equations, optimizing functions, and constructing approximations across pure and applied mathematics.</p>
